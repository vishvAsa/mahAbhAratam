  <meta property="og:description" content="THE Pandavas, proceeding according to plan, had closely followed Abhimanyu when he broke into the Kaurava formation. But Dhritarashtra’s son-in-law Jayadratha, the gallant king of the Sindhus, swooped down upon the Pandavas with all his forces and enabled the breach in the formation to be effectively and solidly closed up, so that the Pandavas found it impossible to force their way in. Yudhishthira hurled a javelin and cut Jayadratha’s bow. But in an instant, the Saindhava took up another bow and sent unerring shafts at Dharmaputra. Bhimasena’s arrows made deadly work, crashing down the canopy and flagstaff of Jayadratha’s car. But the Saindhava, was alert and rearmed himself, each time his equipment was broken. He killed Bhima’s chariot horses, and the latter had to go into Satyaki’s car. In this manner, Jayadratha, with stubborn valor, prevented the Pandavas from entering in Abhimanyu’s wake. The young hero was thus isolated and surrounded by the Kaurava forces.The son of Subhadra was however undaunted. He attacked all the warriors around him and slew them in great number. Like rivers losing themselves in the ocean, the soldiers that went to attack him, disappeared before his arrows. The Kaurava army reeled under Abhimanyu’s onslaughts. Duryodhana’s son Lakshmana, a gallant young warrior, then charged on Abhimanyu. When they saw this, retreating soldiers came back and supported Lakshmana, showering arrows on Abhimanyu, like rain falling on a hill. Still, Arjuna’s son was undaunted and, his shaft came swift and shining, like a serpent fresh-sloughed, and pierced Lakshmana. The handsome youth, with beautiful nose and eyebrows and hair, lay dead on the field and the Kaurava soldiers were filled with grief. “To hell with the wicked Abhimanyu,” shouted Duryodhana, and the six great warriors, Dorna, Kripa, Karna, Aswatthama, Brihatbala and Kritavarma closed upon Abhimanyu. “It is impossible to pierce this youth’s armor,” said Drona to Karna. “Aim at the reins of his horses and cut them off. Disable him thus and attack him from behind.” The son of Surya did accordingly. Abhimanyu’s bow was broken by a shaft discharged from behind. His horses and charioteer were killed. Thus disabled, the young warrior stood on the field, with sword and shield, facing his enemies. As he stood dauntless like kshatriya dharma incarnate, he filled the warriors around with amazement. Whirling his sword, he held his own against the numerous warriors who had surrounded him, with a skill that confounded them. It seemed to them as if his feet did not rest on earth and he was on wings, in the air. Drona sent a shaft that broke Abhimanyu’s sword. Karna’s sharp arrows tore his shield into bits. Then Abhimanyu bent down and taking up one of his chariot wheels and whirling it like a discus, stood up facing all the enemies that surrounded him. The dust from the chariot wheel covered him and the poet says it enhanced the natural beauty of the young hero. He fought fiercely like a second Vishnu with the discus. But soon, the combined onslaught of the warriors that surrounded him overpowered him. The chariot wheel was shattered to pieces. The son of Duhsasana came up then and closed with him in mortal combat. Both went down together but Duhsasana’s son rose again and, while Abhimanyu was struggling to his feet, struck him with his mace and killed him. “Subhadra’s son who, like an elephant in a lily pond, single-handed worked havoc in the Kaurava army, was thus overpowered by numbers and killed cruelly,” said Sanjaya to Dhritarashtra. “And, having killed him, your people danced around his dead body like savage hunters exulting over their prey. All good men in the army were grieved and tears rolled from their eyes. Even the birds of prey, that circled overhead making noises seemed to cry ‘Not thus!’ ‘Not thus!’ &#34; While there was blowing of conchs and cries of victory all over the Kaurava army, Yuyutsu, the son of Dhritarashtra, did not approve of all this. “This is ignoble,” he angrily cried. “Soldiers, you have forgotten your code. Verily, you should be ashamed but, instead, you shout brazen cries of victory. Having committed a most wicked deed, you revel in foolish joy, blind to the danger that is imminent.” So saying, Yuyutsu threw his weapon away in disgust and left the battlefield.This young son of Dhritarashtra feared sin. His words were not sweet in the Kaurava ears, but he was a good man and spoke out his mind.">

  <p>THE Pandavas, proceeding according to
plan, had closely followed Abhimanyu
when he broke into the Kaurava
formation. But Dhritarashtra&rsquo;s son-in-law
Jayadratha, the gallant king of the
Sindhus, swooped down upon the
Pandavas with all his forces and enabled
the breach in the formation to be
effectively and solidly closed up, so that
the Pandavas found it impossible to force
their way in.
Yudhishthira hurled a javelin and cut
Jayadratha&rsquo;s bow. But in an instant, the
Saindhava took up another bow and sent
unerring shafts at Dharmaputra.
Bhimasena&rsquo;s arrows made deadly work,
crashing down the canopy and flagstaff of
Jayadratha&rsquo;s car. But the Saindhava, was
alert and rearmed himself, each time his
equipment was broken. He killed Bhima&rsquo;s
chariot horses, and the latter had to go into
Satyaki&rsquo;s car.
In this manner, Jayadratha, with stubborn
valor, prevented the Pandavas from
entering in Abhimanyu&rsquo;s wake. The young
hero was thus isolated and surrounded by
the Kaurava forces.The son of Subhadra was however
undaunted. He attacked all the warriors
around him and slew them in great
number. Like rivers losing themselves in
the ocean, the soldiers that went to attack
him, disappeared before his arrows. The
Kaurava army reeled under Abhimanyu&rsquo;s
onslaughts.
Duryodhana&rsquo;s son Lakshmana, a gallant
young
warrior,
then
charged
on
Abhimanyu. When they saw this,
retreating soldiers came back and
supported Lakshmana, showering arrows
on Abhimanyu, like rain falling on a hill.
Still, Arjuna&rsquo;s son was undaunted and, his
shaft came swift and shining, like a
serpent fresh-sloughed, and pierced
Lakshmana. The handsome youth, with
beautiful nose and eyebrows and hair, lay
dead on the field and the Kaurava soldiers
were filled with grief.
&ldquo;To hell with the wicked Abhimanyu,&rdquo;
shouted Duryodhana, and the six great
warriors,
Dorna,
Kripa,
Karna,
Aswatthama, Brihatbala and Kritavarma
closed upon Abhimanyu.
&ldquo;It is impossible to pierce this youth&rsquo;s
armor,&rdquo; said Drona to Karna. &ldquo;Aim at the
reins of his horses and cut them off.
Disable him thus and attack him from
behind.&rdquo;
The son of Surya did accordingly.
Abhimanyu&rsquo;s bow was broken by a shaft
discharged from behind. His horses and
charioteer were killed. Thus disabled, the
young warrior stood on the field, with
sword and shield, facing his enemies.
As he stood dauntless like kshatriya
dharma incarnate, he filled the warriors
around with amazement. Whirling his
sword, he held his own against the
numerous warriors who had surrounded
him, with a skill that confounded them.
It seemed to them as if his feet did not rest
on earth and he was on wings, in the air.
Drona sent a shaft that broke Abhimanyu&rsquo;s
sword. Karna&rsquo;s sharp arrows tore his
shield into bits.
Then Abhimanyu bent down and taking
up one of his chariot wheels and whirling
it like a discus, stood up facing all the
enemies that surrounded him.
The dust from the chariot wheel covered
him and the poet says it enhanced the
natural beauty of the young hero. He
fought fiercely like a second Vishnu with
the discus.
But soon, the combined onslaught of the
warriors
that
surrounded
him
overpowered him. The chariot wheel was
shattered to pieces. The son of Duhsasana
came up then and closed with him in
mortal combat.
Both went down together but Duhsasana&rsquo;s
son rose again and, while Abhimanyu was
struggling to his feet, struck him with his
mace and killed him.
&ldquo;Subhadra&rsquo;s son who, like an elephant in a
lily pond, single-handed worked havoc in
the Kaurava army, was thus overpowered
by numbers and killed cruelly,&rdquo; said
Sanjaya to Dhritarashtra.
&ldquo;And, having killed him, your people
danced around his dead body like savage
hunters exulting over their prey. All good
men in the army were grieved and tears
rolled from their eyes. Even the birds of
prey, that circled overhead making noises
seemed to cry &lsquo;Not thus!&rsquo; &lsquo;Not thus!&rsquo; &quot;
While there was blowing of conchs and
cries of victory all over the Kaurava army,
Yuyutsu, the son of Dhritarashtra, did not
approve of all this. &ldquo;This is ignoble,&rdquo; he
angrily cried.
&ldquo;Soldiers, you have forgotten your code.
Verily, you should be ashamed but,
instead, you shout brazen cries of victory.
Having committed a most wicked deed,
you revel in foolish joy, blind to the
danger that is imminent.&rdquo;
So saying, Yuyutsu threw his weapon
away in disgust and left the battlefield.This young son of Dhritarashtra feared
sin. His words were not sweet in the
Kaurava ears, but he was a good man and
spoke out his mind.</p>
