  <meta property="og:description" content="“You must certainly become my wife, whoever you may be.” Thus said the great King Santanu to the goddess Ganga who stood before him in human form, intoxicating his senses with her superhuman loveliness. The king earnestly offered for her love his kingdom, his wealth, his all, his very life. Ganga replied: “O king, I shall become your wife. But on certain conditions that neither you nor anyone else should ever ask me who I am, or whence I come. You must also not stand in the way of whatever I do, good or bad, nor must you ever be wroth with me on any account whatsoever. You must not say anything displeasing to me. If you act otherwise, I shall leave you then and there. Do you agree?” The infatuated king vowed his assent, and she became his wife and lived with him. The heart of the king was captivated by her modesty and grace and the steady love she bore him. King Santanu and Ganga lived a life of perfect happiness, oblivious of the passage of time. She gave birth to many children; each newborn babe she took to the Ganges and cast into the river, and then returned to the king with a smiling face. Santanu was filled with horror and anguish at such fiendish conduct, but suffered it all in silence, mindful of the promise be had made. Often he wonderedwho she was, wherefrom she had come and why she acted like a murderous witch. Still bound by his word, and his all- mastering love for her, he uttered no word of blame or remonstrance. Thus she killed seven children. When the eighth child was born and she was about to throw it into the Ganges, Santanu could not bear it any longer. He cried: “Stop, stop, why are you bent on this horrid and unnatural murder of your own innocent babes?” With this outburst the king restrained her. “O great king,” she replied, “you have forgotten your promise, for your heart is set on your child, and you do not need me any more. I go. I shall not kill this child, but listen to my story before you judge me. I, who am constrained to play this hateful role by the curse of Vasishtha, am the goddess Ganga, adored of gods and men. Vasishtha cursed the eight Vasus to be born in the world of men, and moved by their supplications said, I was to be their mother. I bore them to you, and well is it for you that it was so. For you will go to higher regions for this service you have done to the eight Vasus. I shall bring up this last child of yours for some time and then return it to you as my gift.” After saying these words the goddess disappeared with the child. It was this child who later became famous as Bhishma. This was how the Vasus came to incur Vasishtha’s curse. They went for a holiday with their wives to a mountain tract where stood the hermitage of Vasishtha: One of them saw Vasishtha’s cow, Nandini, grazing there. Its divinely beautiful form attracted him and he pointed it out to the ladies. They were all loud in praise of the graceful animal, and one of them requested her husband to secure it for her. He replied: “What need have we, the devas, for the milk of cows? This cow belongs to the sage Vasishtha who is the master of the whole place. Man will certainly become immortal by drinking its milk. But this is no gain to us, who are already immortal. Is it worth our while incurring Vasishtha’s wrath merely to satisfy a whim?” But she was not thus to be put off. “I have a dear companion in the mortal world. It is for her sake that I make this request. Before Vasishtha returns we shall have escaped with the cow. You must certainly do this for my sake, for it is my dearest wish.” Finally her husband yielded. All the Vasus joined together and took the cow and its calf away with them. When Vasishtha returned to his ashrama, he missed the cow and the calf, because they were indispensable for his daily rituals. Very soon he came to know by his yogic insight all that had taken place. Anger seized him and he uttered a curse against the Vasus. The sage, whose sole wealth was his austerity, willed that they should be born into the world of men. When the Vasus came to know of the curse, repentant too late, they threw themselves on the sage’s mercy and implored forgiveness. Vasishtha said: “The curse must needs take its course. Prabhasa, the Vasu who seized the cow, will live long in the world in all glory, but the others will be freed from the curse as soon as born. My words cannot prove ineffective, but I shall soften the curse to this extent.” Afterwards, Vasishtha set his mind again on his austerities, the effect of which had been slightly impaired by his anger. Sages who perform austerities acquire the power to curse, but every exercise of this power reduces their store of merit. The Vasus felt relieved and approached the goddess Ganga and begged of her: “We pray you to become our mother. Forour sake we beseech you to descend to the earth and marry a worthy man. Throw us into the water as soon as we are born and liberate us from the curse.” The goddess granted their prayer, came to the earth and became the wife of Santanu. When the goddess Ganga left Santanu and disappeared with the eighth child, the king gave up all sensual pleasures and ruled the kingdom in a spirit of asceticism. One day he was wandering along the banks of the Ganges when he saw a boy endowed with the beauty and form of Devendra, the king of the gods. The child was amusing himself by casting a dam of arrows across the Ganges in flood, playing with the mighty river as a child with an indulgent mother. To the king who stood transfixed with amazement at the sight, the goddess Ganga revealed herself and presented the child as his own son. She said: “O king, this is that eighth child I bore you. I have brought him up till now. His name is Devavrata. He has mastered the art of arms and equals Parasurama in prowess. He has learnt the Vedas and the Vedanta from Vasishtha, and is well versed in the arts and sciences known to Sukra. Take back with you this child who is a great archer and hero as well as a master in statecraft.” Then she blessed the boy, handed him to his father, the king, and disappeared.">

  <p>&ldquo;You must certainly become my wife,
whoever you may be.&rdquo; Thus said the great
King Santanu to the goddess Ganga who
stood before him in human form,
intoxicating
his
senses
with
her
superhuman loveliness.
The king earnestly offered for her love his
kingdom, his wealth, his all, his very life.
Ganga replied: &ldquo;O king, I shall become
your wife. But on certain conditions that
neither you nor anyone else should ever
ask me who I am, or whence I come. You
must also not stand in the way of
whatever I do, good or bad, nor must you
ever be wroth with me on any account
whatsoever. You must not say anything
displeasing to me. If you act otherwise, I
shall leave you then and there. Do you
agree?&rdquo;
The infatuated king vowed his assent, and
she became his wife and lived with him.
The heart of the king was captivated by
her modesty and grace and the steady love
she bore him. King Santanu and Ganga
lived a life of perfect happiness, oblivious
of the passage of time.
She gave birth to many children; each
newborn babe she took to the Ganges and
cast into the river, and then returned to the
king with a smiling face.
Santanu was filled with horror and
anguish at such fiendish conduct, but
suffered it all in silence, mindful of the
promise be had made. Often he wonderedwho she was, wherefrom she had come
and why she acted like a murderous witch.
Still bound by his word, and his all-
mastering love for her, he uttered no word
of blame or remonstrance.
Thus she killed seven children. When the
eighth child was born and she was about
to throw it into the Ganges, Santanu could
not bear it any longer.
He cried: &ldquo;Stop, stop, why are you bent on
this horrid and unnatural murder of your
own innocent babes?&rdquo; With this outburst
the king restrained her.
&ldquo;O great king,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;you have
forgotten your promise, for your heart is
set on your child, and you do not need me
any more. I go. I shall not kill this child,
but listen to my story before you judge
me. I, who am constrained to play this
hateful role by the curse of Vasishtha, am
the goddess Ganga, adored of gods and
men. Vasishtha cursed the eight Vasus to
be born in the world of men, and moved
by their supplications said, I was to be
their mother. I bore them to you, and well
is it for you that it was so. For you will go
to higher regions for this service you have
done to the eight Vasus. I shall bring up
this last child of yours for some time and
then return it to you as my gift.&rdquo;
After saying these words the goddess
disappeared with the child. It was this
child who later became famous as
Bhishma. This was how the Vasus came
to incur Vasishtha&rsquo;s curse. They went for a
holiday with their wives to a mountain
tract where stood the hermitage of
Vasishtha: One of them saw Vasishtha&rsquo;s
cow, Nandini, grazing there.
Its divinely beautiful form attracted him
and he pointed it out to the ladies. They
were all loud in praise of the graceful
animal, and one of them requested her
husband to secure it for her.
He replied: &ldquo;What need have we, the
devas, for the milk of cows? This cow
belongs to the sage Vasishtha who is the
master of the whole place. Man will
certainly become immortal by drinking its
milk. But this is no gain to us, who are
already immortal. Is it worth our while
incurring Vasishtha&rsquo;s wrath merely to
satisfy a whim?&rdquo;
But she was not thus to be put off. &ldquo;I have
a dear companion in the mortal world. It is
for her sake that I make this request.
Before Vasishtha returns we shall have
escaped with the cow. You must certainly
do this for my sake, for it is my dearest
wish.&rdquo; Finally her husband yielded. All
the Vasus joined together and took the
cow and its calf away with them.
When Vasishtha returned to his ashrama,
he missed the cow and the calf, because
they were indispensable for his daily
rituals.
Very soon he came to know by his yogic
insight all that had taken place. Anger
seized him and he uttered a curse against
the Vasus. The sage, whose sole wealth
was his austerity, willed that they should
be born into the world of men. When the
Vasus came to know of the curse,
repentant too late, they threw themselves
on the sage&rsquo;s mercy and implored
forgiveness.
Vasishtha said: &ldquo;The curse must needs
take its course. Prabhasa, the Vasu who
seized the cow, will live long in the world
in all glory, but the others will be freed
from the curse as soon as born. My words
cannot prove ineffective, but I shall soften
the curse to this extent.&rdquo;
Afterwards, Vasishtha set his mind again
on his austerities, the effect of which had
been slightly impaired by his anger. Sages
who perform austerities acquire the power
to curse, but every exercise of this power
reduces their store of merit.
The Vasus felt relieved and approached
the goddess Ganga and begged of her:
&ldquo;We pray you to become our mother. Forour sake we beseech you to descend to the
earth and marry a worthy man. Throw us
into the water as soon as we are born and
liberate us from the curse.&rdquo; The goddess
granted their prayer, came to the earth and
became the wife of Santanu.
When the goddess Ganga left Santanu and
disappeared with the eighth child, the king
gave up all sensual pleasures and ruled the
kingdom in a spirit of asceticism. One day
he was wandering along the banks of the
Ganges when he saw a boy endowed with
the beauty and form of Devendra, the king
of the gods.
The child was amusing himself by casting
a dam of arrows across the Ganges in
flood, playing with the mighty river as a
child with an indulgent mother. To the
king
who
stood
transfixed
with
amazement at the sight, the goddess
Ganga revealed herself and presented the
child as his own son.
She said: &ldquo;O king, this is that eighth child
I bore you. I have brought him up till now.
His name is Devavrata. He has mastered
the art of arms and equals Parasurama in
prowess. He has learnt the Vedas and the
Vedanta from Vasishtha, and is well
versed in the arts and sciences known to
Sukra. Take back with you this child who
is a great archer and hero as well as a
master in statecraft.&rdquo;
Then she blessed the boy, handed him to
his father, the king, and disappeared.</p>
