  <meta property="og:description" content="“O, DURYODHANA, you are yet alive, hear the news and rejoice! All the Panchalas have been slaughtered. The sons of the Pandavas have also been all done to death. The entire army of theirs has been destroyed. We made a night attack on them when they were asleep. There are only seven survivors now on the Pandava side. On our side, Kripacharya, Kritavarma and I remain.” Thus said Aswatthama to the dying Duryodhana who, on hearing this, slowly opened his eyes and, with struggling breath, gasped out these words: “Aswatthama, you have indeed done for me what neither the great Bhishma nor the valiant Karna could achieve! You have gladdened my heart and I die happy.” Saying this, Duryodhana expired. When he saw the unexpected destruction of his army as a result of the attack during sleep, Yudhishthira gave way to grief and broke down: “At the very moment of victory, we have been totally defeated. The vanquished have indeed triumphed. Draupadi’s children, who survived the onslaught of the formidable Karna, have, by our unwariness, been crushed and destroyed like vermin. We have allowed ourselves to be destroyed like a merchant ship which, having successfully crossed the big seas, returns home but capsizes in a ditch and is lost.” Draupadi was overwhelmed by inconsolable grief. She came to Dharmaputra’s side and wept. “Is there no one to avenge my children’s slaughter, by destroying this great sinner Aswatthama?” she cried. When she said this, the Pandavas immediately went out in search of the murderer. They looked for him in all sorts of places and found him, at last, on the bank of the Ganga, hiding himself behind Vyasa. When he saw the Pandavas and Janardana approaching, Aswatthama quietly took up a blade of grass and charged it with the mantra of destruction and sent it forward saying: “May this destroy the race of the Pandavas.” And it went straight to the womb of Uttara who bore in her the son of Abhimanyu. The race of the Pandavas would have been destroyed thereby but for the intervention of Sri Krishna who saved the child in the mother’s womb. This child was Parikshit who was later crowned by Yudhishthira when the Pandavas retired to the forest. Aswatthama pried out the shining jewel that was part of his head and gave it to Bhima, acknowledging his defeat, and went away to the forest. Bhima took the great jewel and, going to Draupadi said: “Angel of spotless purity, this is for you. The man, who killed your beloved sons, has been vanquished. Duryodhana has been destroyed. I have drunk the blood of Duhsasana. I have avenged the great outrage and discharged my debts.” Draupadi took the jewel and, going up to Yudhishthira bowed and said: “Faultlessking, it befits you to wear this in your crown.”">

  <p>&ldquo;O, DURYODHANA, you are yet alive,
hear the news and rejoice! All the
Panchalas have been slaughtered. The
sons of the Pandavas have also been all
done to death. The entire army of theirs
has been destroyed. We made a night
attack on them when they were asleep.
There are only seven survivors now on the
Pandava side. On our side, Kripacharya,
Kritavarma and I remain.&rdquo;
Thus said Aswatthama to the dying
Duryodhana who, on hearing this, slowly
opened his eyes and, with struggling
breath, gasped out these words:
&ldquo;Aswatthama, you have indeed done for
me what neither the great Bhishma nor the
valiant Karna could achieve! You have
gladdened my heart and I die happy.&rdquo;
Saying this, Duryodhana expired.
When he saw the unexpected destruction
of his army as a result of the attack during
sleep, Yudhishthira gave way to grief and
broke down:
&ldquo;At the very moment of victory, we have
been totally defeated. The vanquished
have
indeed
triumphed.
Draupadi&rsquo;s
children, who survived the onslaught of
the formidable Karna, have, by our
unwariness, been crushed and destroyed
like vermin. We have allowed ourselves to
be destroyed like a merchant ship which,
having successfully crossed the big seas,
returns home but capsizes in a ditch and is
lost.&rdquo;
Draupadi
was
overwhelmed
by
inconsolable
grief.
She
came
to
Dharmaputra&rsquo;s side and wept. &ldquo;Is there no
one to avenge my children&rsquo;s slaughter, by
destroying this great sinner Aswatthama?&rdquo;
she cried.
When she said this, the Pandavas
immediately went out in search of the
murderer. They looked for him in all sorts
of places and found him, at last, on the
bank of the Ganga, hiding himself behind
Vyasa.
When he saw the Pandavas and Janardana
approaching, Aswatthama quietly took up
a blade of grass and charged it with the
mantra of destruction and sent it forward
saying: &ldquo;May this destroy the race of the
Pandavas.&rdquo; And it went straight to the
womb of Uttara who bore in her the son of
Abhimanyu.
The race of the Pandavas would have been
destroyed thereby but for the intervention
of Sri Krishna who saved the child in the
mother&rsquo;s womb. This child was Parikshit
who was later crowned by Yudhishthira
when the Pandavas retired to the forest.
Aswatthama pried out the shining jewel
that was part of his head and gave it to
Bhima, acknowledging his defeat, and
went away to the forest. Bhima took the
great jewel and, going to Draupadi said:
&ldquo;Angel of spotless purity, this is for you.
The man, who killed your beloved sons,
has been vanquished. Duryodhana has
been destroyed. I have drunk the blood of
Duhsasana. I have avenged the great
outrage and discharged my debts.&rdquo;
Draupadi took the jewel and, going up to
Yudhishthira bowed and said: &ldquo;Faultlessking, it befits you to wear this in your
crown.&rdquo;</p>
