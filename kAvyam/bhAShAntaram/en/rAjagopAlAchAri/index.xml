It may be claimed that the&#xA;former play an even more important part&#xA;in the formation of ideals, which give to&#xA;character its impulse of growth.&#xA;In the moving history of our land, from&#xA;time immemorial great minds have been&#xA;formed and nourished and touched to&#xA;heroic deeds by the Ramayana and the&#xA;Mahabharata. In most Indian homes,&#xA;children formerly learnt these immortal&#xA;stories as they learnt their mother tongue&#xA;at the mother&amp;rsquo;s knee. And the sweetness&#xA;and sorrows of Sita and Draupadi, the&#xA;heroic fortitude of Rama and Arjuna and&#xA;the loving fidelity of Lakshmana and&#xA;Hanuman became the stuff of their young&#xA;philosophy of life.&#xA;The growing complexity of life has&#xA;changed the simple pattern of early home&#xA;life. Still, there are few in our land who do&#xA;not know the Ramayana and the&#xA;Mahabharata. Though the stories come to&#xA;them so embroidered with the garish&#xA;fancies of the Kalakshepam (devotional&#xA;meeting where an expert scholar and&#xA;singer tells a story to his audience) and the&#xA;cinema as to retain but little of the dignity&#xA;and approach to truth of Vyasa or&#xA;Valmiki. Vyasa&amp;rsquo;s Mahabharata is one of&#xA;our noblest heritages. And it is my&#xA;cherished belief that to hear it faithfully&#xA;told is to love it and come under its&#xA;elevating influence. It strengthens the soul&#xA;and drives home, as nothing else does, the&#xA;vanity of ambition and the evil and futility&#xA;of anger and hatred.&#xA;The realities of life are idealised by genius&#xA;and given the form that makes drama,&#xA;poetry or great prose. Since literature is&#xA;closely related to life, so long as the&#xA;human family is divided into nations,&#xA;literature cannot escape the effects of such&#xA;division.&#xA;But the highest literature transcends&#xA;regionalism and through it, when we are&#xA;properly attuned, we realise the essential&#xA;oneness of the human family. The&#xA;Mahabharata is of this class. It belongs to&#xA;the world and not only to India. To the&#xA;people of India, indeed, this epic has been&#xA;an unfailing and perennial source of&#xA;spiritual strength. Learnt at the mother&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;knee with reverence and love, it has&#xA;inspired great men to heroic deeds as well&#xA;as enabled the humble to face their trials&#xA;with fortitude and faith.&#xA;The Mahabharata was composed many&#xA;thousand years ago. But generations of&#xA;gifted reciters have added to Vyasa&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;original a great mass of material. All the&#xA;floating literature that was thought to be&#xA;worth preserving, historical, geographical,&#xA;legendary&#xA;political,&#xA;theological&#xA;and&#xA;philosophical, of nearly thirty centuries,&#xA;found a place in it.&#xA;In those days, when there was no printing,&#xA;interpolation in a recognised classic&#xA;seemed to correspond to inclusion in the&#xA;national library.&#xA;Divested of these&#xA;accretions, the Mahabharata is a noble&#xA;poem possessing in a supreme degree the&#xA;characteristics of a true epic, great and&#xA;fateful movement, heroic characters and&#xA;stately diction.&#xA;The characters in the epic move with the&#xA;vitality of real life. It is difficult to find&#xA;anywhere such vivid portraiture on so&#xA;ample a canvas. Bhishma, the perfect&#xA;knight; the venerable Drona; the vain but&#xA;chivalrous Karna; Duryodhana, whose&#xA;perverse pride is redeemed by great&#xA;courage in adversity; the high souled&#xA;Pandavas with godlike strength as well as&#xA;power of suffering; Draupadi, most&#xA;unfortunate of queens; Kunti, the worthymother of heroes; Gandhari, the devoted&#xA;wife and sad mother of the wicked sons of&#xA;Dhritarashtra, these are some of the&#xA;immortal figures on that crowded, but&#xA;never confused, canvas.&#xA;Then there is great Krishna himself, most&#xA;energetic of men, whose divinity&#xA;scintillates through a cloud of very human&#xA;characteristics. His high purposefulness&#xA;pervades the whole epic. One can read&#xA;even a translation and feel the over&#xA;whelming power of the incomparable&#xA;vastness and sublimity of the poem.&#xA;The Mahabharata discloses a rich&#xA;civilisation and a highly evolved society,&#xA;which though of an older world, strangely&#xA;resembles the India of our own time, with&#xA;the same values and ideals. India was&#xA;divided into a number of independent&#xA;kingdoms.&#xA;Occasionally,&#xA;one&#xA;king,&#xA;more&#xA;distinguished or ambitious than the rest,&#xA;would assume the title of emperor,&#xA;securing the acquiescence of other&#xA;royalties, and signalised it by a great&#xA;sacrificial feast. The adherence was&#xA;generally voluntary. The assumption of&#xA;imperial title conferred no overlordship.&#xA;The emperor was only first among his&#xA;peers.&#xA;The art of war was highly developed and&#xA;military prowess and skill were held in&#xA;high esteem. We read in the Mahabharata&#xA;of standardised phalanxes and of various&#xA;tactical movements. There was an&#xA;accepted code of honorable warfare,&#xA;deviations from which met with reproof&#xA;among Kshatriyas. The advent of the Kali&#xA;age is marked by many breaches of these&#xA;conventions in the Kurukshetra battle, on&#xA;account of the bitterness of conflict,&#xA;frustration and bereavements. Some of the&#xA;most impressive passages in the epic&#xA;center round these breaches of dharma.&#xA;The population lived in cities and villages.&#xA;The cities were the headquarters of kings&#xA;and their household and staff. There were&#xA;beautiful palaces and gardens and the&#xA;lives led were cultured and luxurious.&#xA;There was trade in the cities, but the mass&#xA;of the people were agriculturists.&#xA;Besides this urban and rural life, there was&#xA;a very highly cultured life in the seclusion&#xA;of forest recesses, centerd round ascetic&#xA;teachers. These ashramas kept alive the&#xA;bright fires of learning and spiritual&#xA;thought. Young men of noble birth&#xA;eagerly sought education at these&#xA;ashramas. World-weary aged went there&#xA;for peace. These centers of culture were&#xA;cherished by the rulers of the land and not&#xA;the proudest of them would dare to treat&#xA;the members of the hermitages otherwise&#xA;than with respect and consideration.&#xA;Women were highly honored and entered&#xA;largely in the lives of their husbands and&#xA;sons. The caste system prevailed, but&#xA;intercaste marriages were not unknown.&#xA;Some of the greatest warriors in the&#xA;Mahabharata were brahmanas.&#xA;The&#xA;Mahabharata has moulded the character&#xA;and civilisation of one of the most&#xA;numerous of the world&amp;rsquo;s people.&#xA;How did it fulfil, how is it still continuing&#xA;to fulfil, this function? By its gospel of&#xA;dharma, which like a golden thread runs&#xA;through all the complex movements in the&#xA;epic. By its lesson that hatred breeds&#xA;hatred, that covetousness and violence&#xA;lead inevitably to ruin, that the only real&#xA;conquest is in the battle against one&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;lower nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BHAGAVAN VYASA, the celebrated&#xA;compiler of the Vedas, was the son of the&#xA;great sage Parasara. It was he who gave to&#xA;the world the divine epic of the&#xA;Mahabharata.&#xA;Having conceived the Mahabharata he&#xA;thought of the means of giving the sacred&#xA;story to the world. He meditated on&#xA;Brahma, the Creator, who manifestedhimself before him. Vyasa saluted him&#xA;with bowed head and folded hands and&#xA;prayed:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lord, I have conceived an excellent&#xA;work, but cannot think of one who can&#xA;take it down to my dictation.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Brahma extolled Vyasa and said: &amp;ldquo;O sage,&#xA;invoke Ganapati and beg him to be your&#xA;amanuensis.&amp;rdquo; Having said these words he&#xA;disappeared. The sage Vyasa meditated on&#xA;Ganapati who appeared before him. Vyasa&#xA;received him with due respect and sought&#xA;his aid.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lord Ganapati, I shall dictate the story of&#xA;the Mahabharata and I pray you to be&#xA;graciously pleased to write it down.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ganapati replied: &amp;ldquo;Very well. I shall do as&#xA;you wish. But my pen must not stop while&#xA;I am writing. So you must dictate without&#xA;pause or hesitation. I can only write on&#xA;this condition?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vyasa agreed, guarding himself, however,&#xA;with a counter stipulation: &amp;ldquo;Be it so, but&#xA;you must first grasp the meaning of what I&#xA;dictate before you write it down.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ganapati smiled and agreed to the&#xA;condition. Then the sage began to sing the&#xA;story of the Mahabharata. He would&#xA;occasionally compose some complex&#xA;stanzas which would make Ganapati&#xA;pause a while to get at the meaning and&#xA;Vyasa would avail himself of this interval&#xA;to compose many stanzas in his mind.&#xA;Thus the Mahabharata came to be written&#xA;by Ganapati to the dictation of Vyasa.&#xA;It was before the days of printing, when&#xA;the memory of the learned was the sole&#xA;repository of books. Vyasa first taught the&#xA;great epic to his son, the sage Suka. Later,&#xA;he expounded it to many other disciples.&#xA;Were it not so, the book might have been&#xA;lost to future generations.&#xA;Tradition has it that Narada told the story&#xA;of the Mahabharata to the devas while&#xA;Suka taught it to the Gandharvas, the&#xA;Rakshasas and the Yakshas. It is well&#xA;known that the virtuous and learned&#xA;Vaisampayana, one of the chief disciples&#xA;of Vyasa, revealed the epic for the benefit&#xA;of humanity.&#xA;Janamejaya, the son of the great King&#xA;Parikshit, conducted a great sacrifice in&#xA;the course of which Vaisampayana&#xA;narrated the story at the request of the&#xA;former. Afterwards, this story, as told by&#xA;Vaisampayana, was recited by Suta in the&#xA;forest of Naimisa to an assembly of sages&#xA;under the lead of the Rishi Saunaka.&#xA;Suta addressed the assembly: &amp;ldquo;I had the&#xA;good fortune to hear the story of the&#xA;Mahabharata composed by Vyasa to teach&#xA;humanity dharma and the other ends of&#xA;life. I should like to narrate it to you.&amp;rdquo; At&#xA;these words the ascetics eagerly gathered&#xA;round him.&#xA;Suta continued: &amp;ldquo;I heard the main story of&#xA;the Mahabharata and the episodic tales&#xA;contained therein told by Vaisampayana at&#xA;the&#xA;sacrifice&#xA;conducted&#xA;by&#xA;King&#xA;Janamejaya. Afterwards, I made an&#xA;extensive pilgrimage to various sacred&#xA;places and also visited the battlefield&#xA;where the great battle described in the&#xA;epic was fought. I have now come here to&#xA;meet you all.&amp;rdquo; He then proceeded to tell&#xA;the whole story of the Mahabharata in the&#xA;grand assembly.&#xA;After the death of the great King Santanu,&#xA;Chitrangada became King of Hastinapura&#xA;and he was succeeded by Vichitravirya.&#xA;The latter had two sons, Dhritarashtra and&#xA;Pandu. The elder of the two being born&#xA;blind, Pandu, the younger brother,&#xA;ascended the throne. In the course of his&#xA;reign, Pandu committed a certain offence&#xA;and had to resort to the forest with his two&#xA;wives where he spent many years in&#xA;penance.&#xA;During their stay in the forest, the two&#xA;wives of Pandu, Kunti and Madri gave&#xA;birth to five sons who became well known&#xA;as the five Pandavas. Pandu passed awaywhile they were still living in the forest.&#xA;The sages brought up the five Pandavas&#xA;during their early years.&#xA;When Yudhishthira, the eldest, attained&#xA;the age of sixteen the rishis led them all&#xA;back to Hastinapura and entrusted them to&#xA;the old grandsire Bhishma. In a short time&#xA;the Pandavas gained mastery over the&#xA;Vedas and the Vedanta as well as over the&#xA;various arts, especially pertaining to the&#xA;Kshatriyas. The Kauravas, the sons of the&#xA;blind Dhritarashtra, became jealous of the&#xA;Pandavas and tried to injure them in&#xA;various ways.&#xA;Finally Bhishma, the head of the family,&#xA;intervened to bring about mutual&#xA;understanding and peace between them.&#xA;Accordingly the Pandavas and the&#xA;Kauravas began to rule separately from&#xA;their respective capitals, Indraprastha and&#xA;Hastinapura.&#xA;Some time later, there was a game of dice&#xA;between the Kauravas and the Pandavas&#xA;according to the then prevailing Kshatriya&#xA;code of honor. Sakuni, who played on&#xA;behalf of the Kauravas, defeated&#xA;Yudhishthira. As a result, the Pandavas&#xA;had to be in exile for a period of thirteen&#xA;years. They left the kingdom and went to&#xA;the forest with their devoted wife&#xA;Draupadi.&#xA;According to the conditions of the game,&#xA;the Pandavas spent twelve years in the&#xA;forest and the thirteenth year incognito.&#xA;When they returned and demanded of&#xA;Duryodhana their paternal heritage, the&#xA;latter, who had in the meanwhile usurped&#xA;their kingdom, refused to return it. War&#xA;followed as a consequence.&#xA;The Pandavas defeated Duryodhana and&#xA;regained their patrimony. The Pandavas&#xA;ruled the kingdom for thirty-six years.&#xA;Afterwards, they transferred the crown to&#xA;their grandson, Parikshit, and repaired to&#xA;the forest with Draupadi, all clad humbly&#xA;in barks of trees.&#xA;This is the substance of the story of the&#xA;Mahabharata. In this ancient and&#xA;wonderful epic of our land there are many&#xA;illustrative tales and sublime teachings,&#xA;besides the narrative of the fortunes of the&#xA;Pandavas.&#xA;The Mahabharata is in fact a veritable&#xA;ocean containing countless pearls and&#xA;gems. It is, with the Ramayana, a living&#xA;fountain of the ethics and culture of our&#xA;Motherland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You must certainly become my wife,&#xA;whoever you may be.&amp;rdquo; Thus said the great&#xA;King Santanu to the goddess Ganga who&#xA;stood before him in human form,&#xA;intoxicating&#xA;his&#xA;senses&#xA;with&#xA;her&#xA;superhuman loveliness.&#xA;The king earnestly offered for her love his&#xA;kingdom, his wealth, his all, his very life.&#xA;Ganga replied: &amp;ldquo;O king, I shall become&#xA;your wife. But on certain conditions that&#xA;neither you nor anyone else should ever&#xA;ask me who I am, or whence I come. You&#xA;must also not stand in the way of&#xA;whatever I do, good or bad, nor must you&#xA;ever be wroth with me on any account&#xA;whatsoever. You must not say anything&#xA;displeasing to me. If you act otherwise, I&#xA;shall leave you then and there. Do you&#xA;agree?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The infatuated king vowed his assent, and&#xA;she became his wife and lived with him.&#xA;The heart of the king was captivated by&#xA;her modesty and grace and the steady love&#xA;she bore him. King Santanu and Ganga&#xA;lived a life of perfect happiness, oblivious&#xA;of the passage of time.&#xA;She gave birth to many children; each&#xA;newborn babe she took to the Ganges and&#xA;cast into the river, and then returned to the&#xA;king with a smiling face.&#xA;Santanu was filled with horror and&#xA;anguish at such fiendish conduct, but&#xA;suffered it all in silence, mindful of the&#xA;promise be had made. Often he wonderedwho she was, wherefrom she had come&#xA;and why she acted like a murderous witch.&#xA;Still bound by his word, and his all-&#xA;mastering love for her, he uttered no word&#xA;of blame or remonstrance.&#xA;Thus she killed seven children. When the&#xA;eighth child was born and she was about&#xA;to throw it into the Ganges, Santanu could&#xA;not bear it any longer.&#xA;He cried: &amp;ldquo;Stop, stop, why are you bent on&#xA;this horrid and unnatural murder of your&#xA;own innocent babes?&amp;rdquo; With this outburst&#xA;the king restrained her.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O great king,&amp;rdquo; she replied, &amp;ldquo;you have&#xA;forgotten your promise, for your heart is&#xA;set on your child, and you do not need me&#xA;any more. I go. I shall not kill this child,&#xA;but listen to my story before you judge&#xA;me. I, who am constrained to play this&#xA;hateful role by the curse of Vasishtha, am&#xA;the goddess Ganga, adored of gods and&#xA;men. Vasishtha cursed the eight Vasus to&#xA;be born in the world of men, and moved&#xA;by their supplications said, I was to be&#xA;their mother. I bore them to you, and well&#xA;is it for you that it was so. For you will go&#xA;to higher regions for this service you have&#xA;done to the eight Vasus. I shall bring up&#xA;this last child of yours for some time and&#xA;then return it to you as my gift.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After saying these words the goddess&#xA;disappeared with the child. It was this&#xA;child who later became famous as&#xA;Bhishma. This was how the Vasus came&#xA;to incur Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s curse. They went for a&#xA;holiday with their wives to a mountain&#xA;tract where stood the hermitage of&#xA;Vasishtha: One of them saw Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;cow, Nandini, grazing there.&#xA;Its divinely beautiful form attracted him&#xA;and he pointed it out to the ladies. They&#xA;were all loud in praise of the graceful&#xA;animal, and one of them requested her&#xA;husband to secure it for her.&#xA;He replied: &amp;ldquo;What need have we, the&#xA;devas, for the milk of cows? This cow&#xA;belongs to the sage Vasishtha who is the&#xA;master of the whole place. Man will&#xA;certainly become immortal by drinking its&#xA;milk. But this is no gain to us, who are&#xA;already immortal. Is it worth our while&#xA;incurring Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s wrath merely to&#xA;satisfy a whim?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But she was not thus to be put off. &amp;ldquo;I have&#xA;a dear companion in the mortal world. It is&#xA;for her sake that I make this request.&#xA;Before Vasishtha returns we shall have&#xA;escaped with the cow. You must certainly&#xA;do this for my sake, for it is my dearest&#xA;wish.&amp;rdquo; Finally her husband yielded. All&#xA;the Vasus joined together and took the&#xA;cow and its calf away with them.&#xA;When Vasishtha returned to his ashrama,&#xA;he missed the cow and the calf, because&#xA;they were indispensable for his daily&#xA;rituals.&#xA;Very soon he came to know by his yogic&#xA;insight all that had taken place. Anger&#xA;seized him and he uttered a curse against&#xA;the Vasus. The sage, whose sole wealth&#xA;was his austerity, willed that they should&#xA;be born into the world of men. When the&#xA;Vasus came to know of the curse,&#xA;repentant too late, they threw themselves&#xA;on the sage&amp;rsquo;s mercy and implored&#xA;forgiveness.&#xA;Vasishtha said: &amp;ldquo;The curse must needs&#xA;take its course. Prabhasa, the Vasu who&#xA;seized the cow, will live long in the world&#xA;in all glory, but the others will be freed&#xA;from the curse as soon as born. My words&#xA;cannot prove ineffective, but I shall soften&#xA;the curse to this extent.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Afterwards, Vasishtha set his mind again&#xA;on his austerities, the effect of which had&#xA;been slightly impaired by his anger. Sages&#xA;who perform austerities acquire the power&#xA;to curse, but every exercise of this power&#xA;reduces their store of merit.&#xA;The Vasus felt relieved and approached&#xA;the goddess Ganga and begged of her:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We pray you to become our mother. Forour sake we beseech you to descend to the&#xA;earth and marry a worthy man. Throw us&#xA;into the water as soon as we are born and&#xA;liberate us from the curse.&amp;rdquo; The goddess&#xA;granted their prayer, came to the earth and&#xA;became the wife of Santanu.&#xA;When the goddess Ganga left Santanu and&#xA;disappeared with the eighth child, the king&#xA;gave up all sensual pleasures and ruled the&#xA;kingdom in a spirit of asceticism. One day&#xA;he was wandering along the banks of the&#xA;Ganges when he saw a boy endowed with&#xA;the beauty and form of Devendra, the king&#xA;of the gods.&#xA;The child was amusing himself by casting&#xA;a dam of arrows across the Ganges in&#xA;flood, playing with the mighty river as a&#xA;child with an indulgent mother. To the&#xA;king&#xA;who&#xA;stood&#xA;transfixed&#xA;with&#xA;amazement at the sight, the goddess&#xA;Ganga revealed herself and presented the&#xA;child as his own son.&#xA;She said: &amp;ldquo;O king, this is that eighth child&#xA;I bore you. I have brought him up till now.&#xA;His name is Devavrata. He has mastered&#xA;the art of arms and equals Parasurama in&#xA;prowess. He has learnt the Vedas and the&#xA;Vedanta from Vasishtha, and is well&#xA;versed in the arts and sciences known to&#xA;Sukra. Take back with you this child who&#xA;is a great archer and hero as well as a&#xA;master in statecraft.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then she blessed the boy, handed him to&#xA;his father, the king, and disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WITH joy the king received to his heart&#xA;and his kingdom the resplendent and&#xA;youthful prince Devavrata and crowned&#xA;him as the Yuvaraja, the heir apparent.&#xA;Four years went by. One day as the king&#xA;was wandering on the banks of the&#xA;Yamuna, the air was suddenly filled with&#xA;a fragrance so divinely sweet that the king&#xA;sought for its cause, and he traced it to a&#xA;maiden so lovely that she seemed a&#xA;goddess. A sage had conferred on her the&#xA;boon that a divine perfume should&#xA;emanate from her, and this was now&#xA;pervading the whole forest.&#xA;From the moment the goddess Ganga left&#xA;him, the king had kept his senses under&#xA;control, but the sight of this divinely&#xA;beautiful maiden burst the bonds of&#xA;restraint and filled him with an&#xA;overmastering desire. He asked her to be&#xA;his wife.&#xA;The maiden said: &amp;ldquo;I am a fisherwoman,&#xA;the daughter of the chief of the fishermen.&#xA;May it please you to ask him and get his&#xA;consent.&amp;rdquo; Her voice was sweet as her&#xA;form.&#xA;The father was an astute man.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;O king, there is no doubt that&#xA;this maiden, like every other, has to be&#xA;married to someone and you are indeed&#xA;worthy of her. Still you have to make a&#xA;promise to me before you can have her.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Santanu replied: &amp;ldquo;If it is a just promise I&#xA;shall make it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The chief of the fisherfolk said: &amp;ldquo;The child&#xA;born of this maiden should be the king&#xA;after you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Though almost mad with passion, the king&#xA;could not make this promise, as it meant&#xA;setting aside the godlike Devavrata, the&#xA;son of Ganga, who was entitled to the&#xA;crown.&#xA;It was a price that could not be thought of&#xA;without shame. He therefore returned to&#xA;his capital, Hastinapura, sick with baffled&#xA;desire. He did not reveal the matter to&#xA;anyone and languished in silence.&#xA;One day Devavrata asked his father: &amp;ldquo;My&#xA;father, you have all that your heart could&#xA;wish. Why then are you so unhappy? How&#xA;is it that you are like one pining away with&#xA;a secret sorrow?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The king replied: &amp;ldquo;Dear son, what you say&#xA;is true. I am indeed tortured with mental&#xA;pain and anxiety. You are my only son&#xA;and you are always preoccupied with&#xA;military ambitions. Life in the world isuncertain and wars are incessant. If&#xA;anything untoward befalls you our family&#xA;will become extinct. Of course, you are&#xA;equal to a hundred sons. Still, those who&#xA;are well read in the scriptures say that in&#xA;this transitory world having but one son is&#xA;the same as having no son at all. It is, not&#xA;proper that the perpetuation of our family&#xA;should depends on a single life, and above&#xA;all things I desire the perpetuation of our&#xA;family. This is the cause of my anguish.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The father prevaricated, being ashamed to&#xA;reveal the whole story to his son.&#xA;Thewise Devavrata realised that there&#xA;must be a secret cause for the mental&#xA;condition of his father, and questioning&#xA;the king&amp;rsquo;s charioteer came to know of his&#xA;meeting with the fishermaiden on the&#xA;banks of the Yamuna. He went to the&#xA;chief of the fishermen and besought his&#xA;daughter&amp;rsquo;s hand on his father&amp;rsquo;s behalf.&#xA;The fisherman was respectful, but firm:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My daughter is indeed fit to be the king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;spouse. Then should not her son become&#xA;king? But you have been crowned as the&#xA;heir apparent and will naturally succeed&#xA;your father. It is this that stands in the&#xA;way.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Devavrata replied: &amp;ldquo;I give you my word&#xA;that the son born of this maiden shall be&#xA;king. And I renounce in his favor my right&#xA;as heir apparent,&amp;rdquo; and he took a vow to&#xA;that effect.&#xA;The chief of the fishermen said: &amp;ldquo;O best of&#xA;the Bharata race, you have done what no&#xA;one else born of royal blood has you have&#xA;done till now. You are indeed a hero. You&#xA;can yourself conduct my daughter to the&#xA;king, your father. Still, hear with patience&#xA;these words of mine which I say as the&#xA;father of the girl.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have no doubt you will keep your word,&#xA;but how can I hope that the children born&#xA;of you will renounce their birthright?&#xA;Your sons will naturally be mighty heroes&#xA;like you, and will be hard to resist if they&#xA;seek to seize the kingdom by force. This is&#xA;the doubt that torments me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When he heard this knotty question posed&#xA;by the girl&amp;rsquo;s father, Devavrata, who was&#xA;bent on fulfilling the king&amp;rsquo;s desire, made&#xA;his supreme renunciation. He vowed with&#xA;upraised arm to the father of the maiden:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I shall never marry and I dedicate myself&#xA;to a life of unbroken chastity.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And as he uttered these words of&#xA;renunciation the gods showered flowers&#xA;on his head, and cries of &amp;ldquo;Bhishma,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Bhishma&amp;rdquo;&#xA;resounded&#xA;in&#xA;the&#xA;air.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Bhishma&amp;rdquo; means one who undertakes a&#xA;terrible vow and fulfils it. That name&#xA;became the celebrated epithet of&#xA;Devavrata from that time. Then the son of&#xA;Ganga led the maiden Satyavati to his&#xA;father.&#xA;Two sons were born of Satyavati to&#xA;Santanu, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya,&#xA;who ascended the throne one after the&#xA;other. Vichitravirya had two sons,&#xA;Dhritarashtra&#xA;and&#xA;Pandu,&#xA;born&#xA;respectively of his two queens, Ambika&#xA;and Ambalika.&#xA;The sons of Dhritarashtra, a hundred in&#xA;number, were known as the Kauravas.&#xA;Pandu had five sons who became famous&#xA;as the Pandavas. Bhishma lived long,&#xA;honored by all as the grandsire until the&#xA;end of the famous battle of Kurukshetra.&#xA;The Family Tree&#xA;Santanu&#xA;(by Ganga)&#xA;(by Satyavati)&#xA;Bhishma&#xA;Chitrangada&amp;amp;Vichitravirya&#xA;(by Ambika)&#xA;(by Ambalika)&#xA;Dhtitarashtra Pandu&#xA;?&#xA;?&#xA;The Kauravas The Pandavas&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHITRANGADA, the son of Satyavati,&#xA;was killed in battle with a Gandharva. As&#xA;he&#xA;died&#xA;childless,&#xA;his&#xA;brother,&#xA;Vichitravirya, was the rightful heir and&#xA;was duly crowned king. And as he was a&#xA;minor, Bhishma governed the kingdom in&#xA;his name till be came of age.&#xA;When Vichitravirya reached adolescence&#xA;Bhishma cast about for a bride for him.&#xA;And as he heard that the daughters of the&#xA;king of Kasi were to choose theirhusbands&#xA;according to the ancient Kshatriya&#xA;practice he went there to secure them for&#xA;his brother.&#xA;The rulers of Kosla, Vanga, Pundra,&#xA;Kalinga and other princes and potentates&#xA;had also repaired to Kasi for the&#xA;swayamvara, attired in their best. The&#xA;princesses were so far-famed for beauty&#xA;and accomplishments that there was fierce&#xA;competition to win them.&#xA;Bhishma was famous among the&#xA;Kshatriyas as a mighty man-at-arms. At&#xA;first everyone thought that the redoubtable&#xA;hero had come merely to witness the&#xA;festivities of the swayamvara. But when&#xA;they found that he was also a suitor, the&#xA;young princes felt themselves let down&#xA;and were full of chagrin. They did not&#xA;know that he had really come for the sake&#xA;of his brother, Vichitravirya.&#xA;The princes began to cast affronts at&#xA;Bhishma: &amp;ldquo;This most excellent and wise&#xA;descendant of the Bharata race forgets that&#xA;he is too old and forgets also his vow of&#xA;celibacy. What has this old man to do with&#xA;this swayamvara? Fie on him!&amp;rdquo; The&#xA;princesses who were to choose their&#xA;husbands barely glanced at the old man&#xA;and looked away.&#xA;Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;wrath&#xA;flamed&#xA;up.&#xA;He&#xA;challenged the assembled princes to a trial&#xA;of their manhood and defeated them all.&#xA;And taking the three princesses in his&#xA;chariot he set out for Hastinapura.&#xA;But before he had gone far, Salva, the&#xA;king of the Saubala country who was&#xA;attached to Amba, intercepted and&#xA;opposed him. For that princess had&#xA;mentally chosen Salva as her husband.&#xA;After a bitter fight Salva was worsted, and&#xA;no wonder, as Bhishma was a peerless&#xA;bowman. But at the request of the&#xA;princesses Bhishma spared his life.&#xA;Arriving&#xA;in&#xA;Hastinapura&#xA;with&#xA;the&#xA;princesses, Bhishma made preparations&#xA;for their marriage to Vichitravirya. When&#xA;all were assembled for the marriage,&#xA;Amba smiled mockingly at Bhishma and&#xA;addressed him as follows: &amp;ldquo;O son of&#xA;Ganga, you are aware of what is enjoined&#xA;in the scriptures. I have mentally chosen&#xA;Salva, the king of Saubala, as my&#xA;husband. You have brought me here by&#xA;force. Knowing this, do what you, learned&#xA;in the scriptures, should do.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhishma admitted the force of her&#xA;objection and sent her to Salva with&#xA;proper escort. The marriage of Ambika&#xA;and Ambalika, the two younger sisters,&#xA;with Vichitravirya was duly solemnised.&#xA;Amba went rejoicing to Salva and told&#xA;him what had happened: &amp;ldquo;I have mentally&#xA;chosen you as my husband from the very&#xA;start. Bhishma has sent me to you. Marry&#xA;me according to the sastras.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Salva replied: &amp;ldquo;Bhishma defeated me in&#xA;sight of all, and carried you away. I have&#xA;been disgraced. So, I cannot receive you&#xA;now as my wife. Return to him and do as&#xA;he commands.&amp;rdquo; With these words Salva&#xA;sent her back to Bhishma.&#xA;She returned to Hastinapura and told&#xA;Bhishma of what had taken place. The&#xA;grandsire tried to induce Vichitravirya to&#xA;marry her. But Vichitravirya roundly&#xA;refused to marry a maiden whose heart&#xA;had already been given to another.&#xA;Amba then turned to Bhishma and she&#xA;sought him to marry her himself as there&#xA;was no other recourse. It was impossiblefor Bhishma to break his vow, sorry as he&#xA;was for Amba. And after some vain&#xA;attempts to make Vichitravirya change his&#xA;mind, he told her there was no way left to&#xA;her but to go again to Salva and seek to&#xA;persuade him.&#xA;This at first she was too proud to do, and&#xA;for long years she abode in Hastinapura.&#xA;Finally, in sheer desperation, she went to&#xA;Salva and found him adamant in refusal.&#xA;The lotus-eyed Amba spent six bitter&#xA;years in sorrow and baffled hope. And her&#xA;heart was seared with suffering and all the&#xA;sweetness in her turned to gall and fierce&#xA;hatred towards Bhishma as the cause of&#xA;her blighted life.&#xA;She sought in vain for a champion among&#xA;the princes to fight and kill Bhishma and&#xA;thus avenge her wrongs but even the&#xA;foremost warriors were afraid of Bhishma&#xA;and paid no heed to her appeal.&#xA;At last, she resorted to hard austerities to&#xA;get the grace of Lord Subrahmanya. He&#xA;graciously appeared before her and gave&#xA;her a garland of ever-fresh lotuses, saying&#xA;that the wearer of that garland would&#xA;become the enemy of Bhishma.&#xA;Amba took the garland and again be&#xA;sought every Kshatriya to accept the&#xA;garland gift of the six-faced Lord and to&#xA;champion her cause. But no one had the&#xA;hardihood to antagonise Bhishma.&#xA;Finally, she went to King Drupada who&#xA;also refused to grant her prayer. She then&#xA;hung the garland at Drupada&amp;rsquo;s palace gate&#xA;and went away to the forest. Some&#xA;ascetics whom she met there and to whom&#xA;she told her sorrowful tale advised her to&#xA;go to Parasurama as a suppliant. She&#xA;followed their advice.&#xA;On hearing her sad story, Parasurama was&#xA;moved with compassion and said: &amp;ldquo;Dear&#xA;child, what do you want? I can ask Salva&#xA;to marry you if you wish it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Amba said: &amp;ldquo;No, I do not wish it. I no&#xA;longer desire marriage or home or&#xA;happiness. There is now but one thing in&#xA;life for me, revenge on Bhishma. The only&#xA;boon I seek is the death of Bhishma.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Parasurama moved as much by her&#xA;anguish as by his abiding hatred of the&#xA;Kshatriya race, espoused her cause and&#xA;fought with Bhishma. It was a long and&#xA;equal combat between the two greatest&#xA;men-at-arms of the age. But in the end&#xA;Parasurama had to acknowledge defeat.&#xA;He told Amba: &amp;ldquo;I have done all that I&#xA;could and I have failed. Throw yourself&#xA;on the mercy of Bhishma. That is the only&#xA;course left to you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Consumed with grief and rage, and kept&#xA;alive only by the passion for revenge,&#xA;Amba went to the Himalayas and&#xA;practised rigorous austerities to get the&#xA;grace of Siva, now that all human aid had&#xA;failed her. Siva appeared before her and&#xA;granted her a boon, that in her next birth&#xA;she would slay Bhishma.&#xA;Amba was impatient for that rebirth which&#xA;would give her heart&amp;rsquo;s desire. She made a&#xA;pyre and plunged into the fire pouring out&#xA;the flame in her heart into the scarcely&#xA;hotter blaze of the pyre.&#xA;By the grace of Lord Siva, Amba was&#xA;born as the daughter of King Drupada. A&#xA;few years after her birth, she saw the&#xA;garland of never-fading flowers that still&#xA;hung at the palace gate and had remained&#xA;there untouched by anyone through fear.&#xA;She put it round her neck. Her father&#xA;Drupada was in consternation at her&#xA;temerity which he feared would draw on&#xA;his head the wrath of Bhishma.&#xA;He sent his daughter in exile out of the&#xA;capital to the forest. She practised&#xA;austerities in the forest and in time was&#xA;transformed into a male and became&#xA;known as the warrior Sikhandin.&#xA;With Sikhandin as his charioteer, Arjuna&#xA;attacked Bhishma on the battlefield of&#xA;Kurukshetra.&#xA;Bhishma&#xA;knew&#xA;that&#xA;Sikhandin was born as female, and true tohis code of chivalry he would not fight&#xA;him under any circumstance.&#xA;So it was that Arjuna could fight screened&#xA;by Sikhandin and conquer Bhishma,&#xA;especially because Bhishma knew that his&#xA;long and weary probation on earth was&#xA;finished and consented to be vanquished.&#xA;As the arrows struck Bhishma in his last&#xA;fight, he singled out those which had&#xA;pierced him deepest and said: &amp;ldquo;This is&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s arrow and not Sikhandin&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;rdquo; So&#xA;fell this great warrior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IN ancient times, there was a bitter&#xA;struggle between the devas or gods and&#xA;the asuras or demons for the lordship of&#xA;the three worlds. Both belligerents had&#xA;illustrious preceptors. Brihaspati who was&#xA;pre-eminent in the knowledge of the&#xA;Vedas was the guiding spirit of the devas,&#xA;while the asuras relied on Sukracharya&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;profound wisdom.&#xA;The asuras had the formidable advantage&#xA;that Sukracharya alone possessed the&#xA;secret of Sanjivini which could recall the&#xA;dead to life. Thus the asuras who had&#xA;fallen in the battle were brought back to&#xA;life, time and again, and continued their&#xA;fight with the devas. The devas were thus&#xA;at a great disadvantage in their long&#xA;drawn-out war with their natural foes.&#xA;They went to Kacha, the son of&#xA;Brihaspati, and besought his aid. They&#xA;begged him to win his way into the good&#xA;graces of Sukracharya and persuade him&#xA;to take him as a pupil. Once admitted to&#xA;intimacy and confidence, he was to&#xA;acquire, by fair means or foul, the secret&#xA;of Sanjivini and remove the great&#xA;handicap under which the devas suffered.&#xA;Kacha acceded to their request and set out&#xA;to meet Sukracharya who lived in the&#xA;capital city of Vrishaparva, the king of the&#xA;asuras. Kacha went to the house of Sukra,&#xA;and after due salutation, addressed him&#xA;thus: &amp;ldquo;I am Kacha, the grandson of the&#xA;sage Angiras and the son of Brihaspati. I&#xA;am a brahmacharin seeking knowledge&#xA;under your tutelage.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It was the law that the wise teacher should&#xA;not refuse a worthy pupil who sought&#xA;knowledge of him. So Sukra acceded and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Kacha, you belong to a good&#xA;family. I accept you as my pupil, the more&#xA;willingly, that by doing so I shall also be&#xA;showing my respect for Brihaspati.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kacha&#xA;spent&#xA;many&#xA;years&#xA;under&#xA;Sukracharya, rendering to perfection the&#xA;prescribed duties in the household of his&#xA;master. Sukracharya had a lovelydaughter,&#xA;Devayani, of whom he was extremely&#xA;fond. Kacha devoted himself to pleasing&#xA;and serving her with song and dance and&#xA;pastime and succeeded in winning her&#xA;affection, without detriment however to&#xA;the vows of brahmacharya.&#xA;When the asuras came to know of this,&#xA;they became anxious as they suspected&#xA;that Kacha&amp;rsquo;s object was somehow to&#xA;wheedle out of Sukracharya the secret of&#xA;Sanjivini. They naturally sought to&#xA;prevent such a calamity.&#xA;One day, as Kacha was engaged in&#xA;grazing the cattle of his master the asuras&#xA;seized him, tore him to pieces and cast his&#xA;flesh to the dogs. When the cattle returned&#xA;without Kacha, Devayani was filled with&#xA;anxiety, and ran to her father with loud&#xA;lamentations: &amp;ldquo;The sun has set,&amp;rdquo; she&#xA;wailed, &amp;ldquo;and your nightly fire sacrifice has&#xA;been performed; still Kacha has not&#xA;returned home. The cattle have come back&#xA;by themselves. I fear some mishap has&#xA;befallen Kacha. I cannot live without&#xA;him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The fond father employed the art of&#xA;Sanjivini and invoked the dead youth to&#xA;appear. At once Kacha came back to life&#xA;and greeted the master with smiles. Asked&#xA;by Devayani the reason for his delay, he&#xA;told her that as he was grazing the cattle&#xA;the asuras came suddenly on him and slewhim. How he came back to life he knew&#xA;not, but come back to life he did, and&#xA;there he was.&#xA;On another occasion Kacha went to the&#xA;forest to pluck flowers for Devayani, and&#xA;again the asuras seized and killed him,&#xA;and pounding his body to a paste, mixed it&#xA;up in sea-water. As he did not return even&#xA;after a long time Devayani went as before&#xA;to her father who brought Kacha back to&#xA;life by his Sanjivini, and heard from him&#xA;all that had taken place.&#xA;For the third time again, the Asuras killed&#xA;Kacha and very cleverly as they thought,&#xA;burnt his body, mixed the ashes in wine&#xA;and served it to Sukracharya who drank it,&#xA;suspecting nothing. Once more the cows&#xA;returned home without their keeper, and&#xA;once again Devayani approached her&#xA;father with her distressful appeal for&#xA;Kacha.&#xA;Sukracharya tried in vain to console his&#xA;daughter. &amp;ldquo;Though I have again and again&#xA;brought back Kacha to life,&amp;rdquo; said he, &amp;ldquo;the&#xA;asuras seem bent upon killing him. Well,&#xA;death is the common lot, and it is not&#xA;proper for a wise soul like you to sorrow&#xA;at it. Your life is all before you to enjoy,&#xA;with youth and beauty and the goodwill of&#xA;the world.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Devayani deeply loved Kacha, and since&#xA;the world began, wise words have never&#xA;cured the ache of bereavement. She said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Kacha, the grandson of Angiras and the&#xA;son of Brihaspati, was a blameless boy,&#xA;who was devoted and tireless in our&#xA;service. I loved him dearly, and now that&#xA;he has been killed, life to me has become&#xA;bleak and insupportable. I shall therefore&#xA;follow in his path.&amp;rdquo; And Devayani began&#xA;to fast. Sukracharya, heart-stricken by his&#xA;daughter&amp;rsquo;s sorrow, became very angry&#xA;with the asuras, and felt that the heinous&#xA;sin of killing a brahmana would weigh&#xA;heavily on their fortunes.&#xA;He employed the Sanjivini art and called&#xA;upon Kacha to appear. By the power of&#xA;the Sanjivini Kacha dispersed as he was in&#xA;the wine which was inside Sukracharya&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;body at the time, regained life, but&#xA;prevented by the peculiarity of his&#xA;location from coming out, he could only&#xA;answer to his name from where he was.&#xA;Sukracharya&#xA;exclaimed&#xA;in&#xA;angry&#xA;amazement: &amp;ldquo;O brahmacharin, how did&#xA;you get into me? Is this also the work of&#xA;the asuras? This is really too bad and&#xA;makes me feel like killing the asuras&#xA;immediately and joining the devas. But&#xA;tell me the whole story.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kacha narrated it all, in spite of the&#xA;inconvenience imposed by his position.&#xA;Vaisampayana continued: &amp;ldquo;The high-&#xA;souled and austere Sukracharya of&#xA;immeasurable greatness, became angry at&#xA;the deceit practised on him in his wine,&#xA;and proclaimed for the benefit of&#xA;humanity: &amp;lsquo;Virtue will desert the man who&#xA;through lack of wisdom drinks wine. He&#xA;will be an object of scorn to all, This is&#xA;my message to humanity, which should be&#xA;regarded as an imperative scriptural&#xA;injunction.&amp;rsquo; Then he turned to his daughter&#xA;Devayani and said: Dear daughter, here is&#xA;a problem for you. For Kacha to live, he&#xA;must rend my stomach and come out of it,&#xA;and that means death to me. His life can&#xA;only be bought by my death.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Devayani began to weep and said: &amp;ldquo;Alas!&#xA;It is death to me either way. For if either&#xA;of you perish, I shall not survive.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sukracharya sought a way out of the&#xA;difficulty. The real explanation of it all&#xA;flashed on him.&#xA;He said to Kacha: &amp;ldquo;O son of Brihaspati, I&#xA;now see with what object you came and&#xA;verily you have secured it! I must bring&#xA;you out to life for the sake of Devayani,&#xA;but equally for her sake I must not die&#xA;either. The only way is to initiate you in&#xA;the art of Sanjivini so that you can bringme back to life after I shall have died&#xA;when a way is torn out through my&#xA;entrails for you. You should employ the&#xA;knowledge I am going to impart to you&#xA;and revive me, so that Devayani need not&#xA;grieve for either of us.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accordingly Sukracharya imparted the art&#xA;of Sanjivini to Kacha. Immediately Kacha&#xA;came forth from Sukracharya&amp;rsquo;s body,&#xA;emerging like the full moon from a cloud,&#xA;while the great preceptor fell down&#xA;mangled and dead.&#xA;But Kacha at once brought Sukracharya&#xA;back to life by means of his newly&#xA;acquired Sanjivini. Kacha bowed down to&#xA;Sukracharya and said: &amp;ldquo;The teacher who&#xA;imparts wisdom to the ignorant is a father.&#xA;Besides, as I have issued from your body&#xA;you are my mother too.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kacha remained for many more years&#xA;under the tutelage of Sukracharya. When&#xA;the period of his vow ended, he took leave&#xA;of his master to return to the world of the&#xA;gods.&#xA;As he was about to depart Devayani&#xA;humbly&#xA;addressed&#xA;him&#xA;thus:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O,&#xA;grandchild of Angiras, you have won my&#xA;heart by your blameless life, your great&#xA;attainments and nobility of birth. I have&#xA;loved you long and tenderly, even while&#xA;you were faithfully following your vows&#xA;of a brahmacharin. You should now&#xA;reciprocate my love and make me happy&#xA;by marrying me. Brihaspati as well as&#xA;yourself are fully worthy of being honored&#xA;by me. &amp;quot;&#xA;In those days, it was no uncommon thing&#xA;for wise and learned brahmana ladies to&#xA;speak out their mind with honorable&#xA;frankness. But Kacha said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O faultless one, you are my master&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;daughter and ever worthy of my respect. I&#xA;got back my life by being born out of your&#xA;father&amp;rsquo;s body. Hence I am your brother. It&#xA;is not proper for you, my sister, to ask me&#xA;to wed you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Devayani sought in vain to persuade him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are the son of Brihaspati,&amp;rdquo; said she,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;and not of my father. If I have been the&#xA;cause of your coming back to life, it was&#xA;because I loved you as indeed I have&#xA;always loved you as my husband. It is not&#xA;fit that you should give up one like me&#xA;sinless and devoted to you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kacha replied: &amp;ldquo;Do not seek to persuade&#xA;me&#xA;to&#xA;unrighteousness.&#xA;You&#xA;are&#xA;enchanting more so now than ever,&#xA;flushed as you are with anger. But I am&#xA;your brother. Pray bid me adieu. Serve&#xA;unto perfection, ever and always, my&#xA;master Sukracharya.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With&#xA;these&#xA;words&#xA;Kacha&#xA;gently&#xA;disengaged himself and proceeded to the&#xA;abode of Indra, the king of gods.&#xA;Sukracharya consoled his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ONE warm afternoon, pleasantly tired&#xA;with sporting in the woods Devayani and&#xA;the daughters of Vrishaparva, king of the&#xA;asuras, went to bathe in the cool waters of&#xA;a sylvan pool, depositing their garlands on&#xA;the bank before they entered its waters.&#xA;A strong breeze blew their clothes&#xA;together into a huddled heap and when&#xA;they came to take them up again, some&#xA;mistakes naturally occurred. It so&#xA;happened that princess Sarmishtha, the&#xA;daughter of the king, clad herself in&#xA;Devayani&amp;rsquo;s clothes. The latter was vexed&#xA;and exclaimed half in jest at the&#xA;impropriety of the daughter of a disciple&#xA;wearing the clothes of the master&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;daughter.&#xA;These words were spoken half in jest, but&#xA;the princess Sarmishtha became very&#xA;angry and said arrogantly: &amp;ldquo;Do you not&#xA;know that your father humbly bows in&#xA;reverence to my royal father every day?&#xA;Are you not the daughter of a beggar who&#xA;lives on my father&amp;rsquo;s bounty? You forget I&#xA;am of the royal race which proudly gives,&#xA;while you come of a race which begs andreceives, and you dare to speak thus to&#xA;me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sarmishtha went on, getting angrier and&#xA;angrier as she spoke till, working herself&#xA;up into a fit of anger, she finally slapped&#xA;Devayani on the cheek and pushed her&#xA;into a dry well. The asura maidens&#xA;thought that Devayani had lost her life and&#xA;returned to the palace.&#xA;Devayani had not been killed by the fall&#xA;into the well but was in a sad plight&#xA;because she could not climb up the steep&#xA;sides. Emperor Yayati of the Bharata race&#xA;who was hunting in the forest by a happy&#xA;chance came to this spot in search of&#xA;water to slake his thirst. When he glanced&#xA;into the well, he saw something bright,&#xA;and looking closer, he was surprised to&#xA;find a beautiful maiden lying in the well.&#xA;He asked: &amp;ldquo;Who are you, O beautiful&#xA;maiden with bright earrings and ruddy&#xA;nails? Who is your father? What is your&#xA;ancestry? How did you fall into the well?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She replied: &amp;ldquo;I am the daughter of&#xA;Sukracharya. He does not know that I&#xA;have fallen into the well. Lift me up&amp;rdquo; and&#xA;she held forth her hands. Yayati seized her&#xA;hand and helped her out of the well.&#xA;Devayani did not wish to return to the&#xA;capital of the king of the asuras. She did&#xA;not feel it safe to go there, as she&#xA;pondered again and again on Sarmishtha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;conduct. She told Yayati: &amp;ldquo;You have held&#xA;a maiden by her right hand, and you must&#xA;marry her. I feel that you are in every way&#xA;worthy to be my husband.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yayati replied: &amp;ldquo;Loving soul, I am a&#xA;kshatriya and you are a brahmana maiden.&#xA;How can I marry you? How can the&#xA;daughter of Sukracharya, who is worthy to&#xA;be the preceptor of the whole world,&#xA;submit to be the wife of a kshatriya like&#xA;myself? Revered lady, return home.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having said these words Yayati went back&#xA;to his capital.&#xA;A kshatriya maiden could marry a&#xA;brahmana, according to the ancient&#xA;tradition, but it was considered wrong for&#xA;a brahmana maiden to marry a kshatriya.&#xA;The important thing was to keep the racial&#xA;status of women unlowered. Hence&#xA;anuloma or the practice of marrying men&#xA;of higher castes was legitimate and the&#xA;reverse practice, known as pratiloma, i.e.&#xA;marrying men of a lower caste, was&#xA;prohibited by the sastras.&#xA;Devayani had no mind to return home.&#xA;She remained sunk in sorrow in the shade&#xA;of a tree in forest. Sukracharya loved&#xA;Devayani more than his life. After waiting&#xA;long in vain for the return of his daughter&#xA;who had gone to play with her&#xA;companions, he sent a woman in search of&#xA;her.&#xA;The messenger after a weary search came&#xA;on her at last near the tree where she was&#xA;sitting in dejection, her eyes red with&#xA;anger and grief. And she asked her what&#xA;had happened.&#xA;Devayani said: &amp;ldquo;Friend, go at once and tell&#xA;my father that I will not set my foot in the&#xA;capital of Vrishaparva&amp;rdquo; and she sent her&#xA;back to Sukracharya.&#xA;Extremely grieved at the sad plight of his&#xA;daughter Sukracharya hurried to her.&#xA;Caressing her, he said: &amp;ldquo;It is by their own&#xA;actions, good or bad, that men are happy&#xA;or miserable. The virtues or vices of&#xA;others will not affect us in the least.&amp;rdquo; With&#xA;these words of wisdom, he tried to&#xA;console her.&#xA;She replied in sorrow and anger: &amp;ldquo;Father,&#xA;leave alone my merits and faults, which&#xA;are after all my own concern. But tell me&#xA;this, was Sarmishtha, the daughter of&#xA;Vrishaparva, right when she told me you&#xA;were but a minstrel singing the praises of&#xA;kings? She called me the daughter of a&#xA;mendicant living on the doles won by&#xA;flattery. Not content with this arrogant&#xA;contumely, she slapped me and threw meinto a pit which was nearby. I cannot stay&#xA;in any place within her father&amp;rsquo;s territory.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And Devayani began to weep.&#xA;Sukracharya drew himself up proudly:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Devayani,&amp;rdquo; he said with dignity, &amp;ldquo;you are&#xA;not the daughter of a court minstrel. Your&#xA;father does not live on the wages of&#xA;flattery. You are the daughter of one who&#xA;is reverenced by all the world. Indra, the&#xA;king of the gods, knows this, and&#xA;Vrishaparva is not ignorant of his debt to&#xA;me. But no worthy man extols his own&#xA;merits, and I shall say no more about&#xA;myself. Arise, you are a peerless gem&#xA;among women, bringing prosperity to&#xA;your family. Be patient. Let us go home.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In this context Bhagavan Vyasa advises&#xA;humanity in general in the following&#xA;words&#xA;of&#xA;counsel&#xA;addressed&#xA;by&#xA;Sukracharya to his daughter:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;He conquers the world, who patiently&#xA;puts up with the abuse of his neighbors.&#xA;He who, controls his anger, as a horseman&#xA;breaks an unruly horse, is indeed a&#xA;charioteer and not he who merely holds&#xA;the reins, but lets the horse go whither it&#xA;would. He who sheds his anger just as a&#xA;snake its slough, is a real hero. He who is&#xA;not moved despite the greatest torments&#xA;inflicted by others, will realise his aim. He&#xA;who never gets angry is superior to the&#xA;ritualist who faith fully performs for a&#xA;hundred years the sacrifices ordained by&#xA;scripture. Servants, friends, brothers, wife,&#xA;children, virtue and truth abandon the man&#xA;who gives way to anger. The wise will not&#xA;take to heart the words of boys and girls.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Devayani humbly told her father: &amp;ldquo;I am&#xA;indeed a little girl, but, I hope, not too&#xA;young to benefit by the great truth taught&#xA;by you. Yet, it is not proper to live with&#xA;persons who have no sense of decency or&#xA;decorum. The wise will not keep company&#xA;with those who speak ill of their family.&#xA;However rich they may be, the ill-&#xA;mannered are really the veritable&#xA;chandalas outside the pale of caste. The&#xA;virtuous should not mix with them. My&#xA;mind is ablaze with the anger roused by&#xA;the taunts of Vrishaparva&amp;rsquo;s daughter. The&#xA;wounds inflicted by weapons may close in&#xA;time; scalds may heal gradually; but&#xA;wounds inflicted by words remain painful&#xA;as long as one lives.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sukracharya went to Vrishaparva and&#xA;fixing his eyes on him gravely said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O king, though one&amp;rsquo;s sins may not bring&#xA;immediate punishment they are sure,&#xA;sooner or later, to destroy the very germ&#xA;of prosperity. Kacha, the son of&#xA;Brihaspati, was a brahmacharin who had&#xA;conquered his senses and never committed&#xA;any sin. He served me with fidelity and&#xA;never strayed from the path of virtue.&#xA;Your attendants tried to kill him. I bore it.&#xA;My daughter, who holds her honor high,&#xA;had to hear dishonoring words uttered by&#xA;your daughter. Besides, she was pushed&#xA;into a well by your daughter. She cannot&#xA;any more stay in your kingdom. Without&#xA;her I cannot live here either. So, I am&#xA;going out of your kingdom.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At these words the king of the asuras was&#xA;sorely troubled and said: &amp;ldquo;I am ignorant of&#xA;the charges laid at my door. If you&#xA;abandon me, I shall enter fire and die.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sukracharya replied: &amp;ldquo;I care more for the&#xA;happiness of my daughter than for the fate&#xA;of you and your asuras, for she is the one&#xA;thing I have and dearer to me than life&#xA;itself. If you can appease her, it is well&#xA;and good. Otherwise I go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vrishaparva and his retinue went to the&#xA;tree under which Devayani stood and they&#xA;threw themselves at her feet in&#xA;supplication.&#xA;Devayani was stubborn and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sarmishtha who told me that I was the&#xA;daughter of a beggar, should become my&#xA;handmaiden and attend on me in the house&#xA;into which my father gives me in&#xA;marriage.&amp;ldquo;Vrishaparva consented and asked his&#xA;attendants&#xA;to&#xA;fetch&#xA;his&#xA;daughter&#xA;Sarmishtha.&#xA;Sarmishtha admitted her fault and bowed&#xA;in submission. She said: &amp;ldquo;Let it be as my&#xA;companion Devayani desires. My father&#xA;shall not lose his preceptor for a fault&#xA;committed by me. I will be her attendant,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Devayani was pacified and returned to her&#xA;house with her father.&#xA;On another occasion also Devayani came&#xA;across Yayati. She repeated her request&#xA;that he should take her as his wife since he&#xA;had clasped her right hand. Yayati again&#xA;repeated his objection that he, a kshatriya,&#xA;could not lawfully marry a brahmana.&#xA;Finally they both went to Sukracharya and&#xA;got his assent to their marriage. This is an&#xA;instance of the pratiloma marriage which&#xA;was resorted to on exceptional occasions.&#xA;The sastras, no doubt, prescribe what is&#xA;right and forbid what is wrong but a&#xA;marriage once effected cannot be made&#xA;invalid.&#xA;Yayati and Devayani spent many days in&#xA;happiness. Sarmishtha remained with her&#xA;as an attendant. One day Sarmishtha met&#xA;Yayati in secret and earnestly prayed to&#xA;betaken also as his wife. He yielded to her&#xA;prayer and married her without the&#xA;knowledge of Devayani.&#xA;But Devayani came to know of it and was&#xA;naturally very angry, She complained to&#xA;her father and Sukracharya in his rage&#xA;cursed Yayati with premature old age.&#xA;Yayati, thus suddenly stricken with age in&#xA;the very prime of his manhood, begged so&#xA;humbly for forgiveness that Sukracharya,&#xA;who had not forgotten Devayani&amp;rsquo;s rescue&#xA;from the well, at last relented.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;O king, you have lost the glory&#xA;which is youth. The curse cannot be&#xA;recalled, but if you can persuade anyone&#xA;to exchange his youth for your age the&#xA;exchange will take effect.&amp;rdquo; Thus he&#xA;blessed Yayati and bade him farewell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EMPEROR Yayati was one of the&#xA;ancestors of the Pandavas. He had never&#xA;known defeat. He followed the dictates of&#xA;the sastras, adored the gods and venerated&#xA;his ancestors with intense devotion. He&#xA;became famous as a ruler devoted to the&#xA;welfare of his subjects.&#xA;But as has already been told, he became&#xA;prematurely old by the curse of&#xA;Sukracharya for having wronged his wife&#xA;Devayani. In the words of the poet of the&#xA;Mahabharata:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yayati attained that old age which&#xA;destroys beauty and brings on miseries.&amp;rdquo; It&#xA;is needless to describe the misery of youth&#xA;suddenly blighted into age, where the&#xA;horrors of loss are accentuated by pangs&#xA;of recollection.&#xA;Yayati, who found himself suddenly an&#xA;old man, was still haunted by the desire&#xA;for sensual enjoyment. He had five&#xA;beautiful&#xA;sons,&#xA;all&#xA;virtuous&#xA;and&#xA;accomplished. Yayati called them and&#xA;appealed piteously to their affection:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The&#xA;curse&#xA;of&#xA;your&#xA;grandfather&#xA;Sukracharya has made me unexpectedly&#xA;and prematurely old. I have not had my&#xA;fill of the joys of life. For, not knowing&#xA;what was in store for me I lived a life of&#xA;restraint, denying myself even lawful&#xA;pleasures. One of you ought to bear the&#xA;burden of my old age and give his youth&#xA;in return. He who agrees to this and&#xA;bestows his youth on me will be the ruler&#xA;of my kingdom. I desire to enjoy life in&#xA;the full vigor of youth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He first asked his eldest son. That son&#xA;replied: &amp;ldquo;O great king, women and&#xA;servants will mock at me if I were to take&#xA;upon myself your old age. I cannot do go.&#xA;Ask of my younger brothers who are&#xA;dearer to you than myself.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When the second son was approached, he&#xA;gently refused with the words: &amp;ldquo;Father,&#xA;you ask me to take up old age thatdestroys not only strength and beauty but&#xA;also as I see wisdom. I am not strong&#xA;enough to do so.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The third son replied: &amp;ldquo;An old man cannot&#xA;ride a horse or an elephant. His speech&#xA;will falter. What can I do in such a&#xA;helpless plight? I cannot agree.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The king was angry and disappointed that&#xA;his three sons had declined to do as he&#xA;wished, but he hoped for better from his&#xA;fourth son, to whom he said: &amp;ldquo;You should&#xA;take up my old age. If you exchange your&#xA;youth with me, I shall give it back to you&#xA;after some time and take back the old age&#xA;with which I have been cursed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The fourth son begged to be forgiven as&#xA;this was a thing he could by no means&#xA;consent to. An old man had to seek the&#xA;help of others even to keep his body clean,&#xA;a most pitiful plight. No, much as he&#xA;loved his father he could not do it.&#xA;Yayati was struck with sorrow at the&#xA;refusal of the four sons. Still, hoping&#xA;against hope, he supplicated his last son&#xA;who had never yet opposed his wishes:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You must save me. I am afflicted with&#xA;this old age with its wrinkles, debility and&#xA;grey hairs as a result of the curse of&#xA;Sukracharya. It is too hard a trial! If you&#xA;will take upon yourself these infirmities, I&#xA;shall enjoy life for just a while more and&#xA;then give you back your youth and resume&#xA;my old age and all its sorrows. Pray, do&#xA;not refuse as your elder brothers have&#xA;done.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Puru, the youngest son, moved by filial&#xA;love, said: &amp;ldquo;Father, I gladly give you my&#xA;youth and relieve you of the sorrows of&#xA;old age and cares of state. Be happy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing these words Yayati embraced&#xA;him. As soon as he touched his son,&#xA;Yayati became a youth. Puru, who&#xA;accepted the old age of his father, ruled&#xA;the kingdom and acquired great renown.&#xA;Yayati enjoyed life for long, and not&#xA;satisfied, went later to the garden of&#xA;Kubera and spent many years with an&#xA;Apsara maiden.&#xA;After long years spent in vain efforts to&#xA;quench desire by indulgence, the truth&#xA;dawned on him.&#xA;Returning to Puru, he said: &amp;ldquo;Dear son,&#xA;sensual desire is never quenched by&#xA;indulgence any more than fire is by&#xA;pouring ghee in it. I had heard and read&#xA;this, but till now I had not realised it. No&#xA;object of desire, corn, gold, cattle or&#xA;women, nothing can ever satisfy the desire&#xA;of man, We can reach peace only by a&#xA;mental poise beyond likes and dislikes.&#xA;Such is the state of Brahman. Take back&#xA;your youth and rule the kingdom wisely&#xA;and well.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With these words Yayati took his old age.&#xA;Puru, who regained his youth, was made&#xA;king by Yayati who retired to the forest.&#xA;He spent his time there in austerities and,&#xA;in due course, attained heaven.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE sage Mandavya who had acquired&#xA;strength of mind and knowledge of the&#xA;scriptures, spent his days in penance and&#xA;the practice of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He lived in a hermitage in the forests on&#xA;the outskirts of the city. One day while he&#xA;was immersed in silent contemplation&#xA;under the shade of a tree outside his hut of&#xA;leaves, a band of robbers fled through the&#xA;woods with officers of the king in hot&#xA;pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SURA, the grandfather of Sri Krishna,&#xA;was a worthy scion of the Yadava race.&#xA;His daughter Pritha was noted for her&#xA;beauty and virtues. Since his cousin&#xA;Kuntibhoja was childless, Sura gave his&#xA;daughter Pritha in adoption to him. From&#xA;that time she was known by the name of&#xA;Kunti after her adoptive father.&#xA;When Kunti was a little girl, the sage&#xA;Durvasa stayed for a time as a guest in her&#xA;father&amp;rsquo;s house and she served the sage for&#xA;a year with all care, patience and&#xA;devotion. He was so pleased with her that&#xA;he gave her a divine mantra. He said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If you call upon any god repeating this&#xA;mantra, he will manifest himself to you&#xA;and bless you with a son equal to him in&#xA;glory.&amp;rdquo; He granted her this boon because&#xA;he foresaw by his yogic power the&#xA;misfortune that was in store for her future&#xA;husband.&#xA;The impatient curiosity of youth made&#xA;Kunti test then and there the efficacy of&#xA;the mantra by repeating it and invoking&#xA;the Sun whom she saw shining in the&#xA;heavens. At once the sky grew dark with&#xA;clouds, and under cover of them the Sun&#xA;god approached the beautiful princess&#xA;Kunti and stood gazing at her with ardent&#xA;soul&#xA;scorching&#xA;admiration.&#xA;Kunti,&#xA;overpowered by the glorious vision of her&#xA;divine visitor, asked: &amp;ldquo;O god, who art&#xA;thou?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Sun replied: &amp;ldquo;Dear maiden, I am the&#xA;Sun. I have been drawn to you by the spell&#xA;of the son-giving mantra that you have&#xA;uttered.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kunti was aghast and said: &amp;ldquo;I am an&#xA;unwedded girl dependent on my father. I&#xA;am not fit for motherhood and do not&#xA;desire it. I merely wished to test the power&#xA;of the boon granted by the sage Durvasa.&#xA;Go back and forgive this childish folly of&#xA;mine.&amp;rdquo; But the Sun god could not thus&#xA;return because the power of the mantra&#xA;held him. She for her part was mortally&#xA;afraid of being blamed by the world. The&#xA;Sun god however reassured her:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;No blame shall attach to you. After&#xA;bearing my son, you will regain virginity.&amp;rsquo;&#39;&#xA;Kunti conceived by the grace of the Sun,&#xA;the giver of light and life to all the world.&#xA;Divine births take place immediately&#xA;without the nine months weary course of&#xA;mortal gestation.&#xA;She gave birth to Karna who was born&#xA;with divine armor and earrings and was&#xA;bright and beautiful like the Sun. In time,&#xA;he became one of the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest&#xA;heroes. After the birth of the child, Kunti&#xA;once again became a virgin as a result of&#xA;the boon granted by the Sun.&#xA;She wondered what she should do with&#xA;the child. To hide her fault she placed the&#xA;child in a sealed box and set it afloat in a&#xA;river. A childless charioteer happened to&#xA;see the floating case, and taking it, was&#xA;surprised and delighted to see within it a&#xA;gorgeously beautiful child.&#xA;He handed it over to his wife who&#xA;lavished a mother&amp;rsquo;s love on it. Thus&#xA;Karna, the son of the Sun god, came to be&#xA;brought up as a charioteer&amp;rsquo;s child. When&#xA;the time came for giving Kunti in&#xA;marriage, Kuntibhoja invited all the&#xA;neighboring&#xA;princes&#xA;and&#xA;held&#xA;aswayamvara for her to choose her&#xA;husband.&#xA;Many eager suitors flocked to the&#xA;swayamvara as the princess was widely&#xA;famed for her great beauty and virtue.&#xA;Kunti placed the garland on the neck of&#xA;King Pandu, the bright representative of&#xA;the Bharata race, whose personality&#xA;eclipsed the lustre of all the other princes&#xA;assembled there. The marriage was duly&#xA;solemnised and she accompanied her&#xA;husband to his capital Hastinapur.&#xA;On the advice of Bhishma and in&#xA;accordance with the prevailing custom,&#xA;Pandu took a second wife Madri, the sister&#xA;of the king of Madra. In the old days the&#xA;kings took two or three wives for making&#xA;sure of progeny and not for mere sensual&#xA;desire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ONE day King Pandu was out hunting. A&#xA;sage and his wife were also sporting in the&#xA;forest in the guise of deer. Pandu shot the&#xA;male with an arrow, in ignorance of the&#xA;fact that it was a sage in disguise. Stricken&#xA;to death the rishi thus cursed Pandu:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sinner, you will meet with death the&#xA;moment you taste the pleasures of the&#xA;bed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Pandu was heartbroken at this curse and&#xA;retreated to the forest with his wives after&#xA;entrusting his kingdom to Bhishma and&#xA;Vidura and lived there a life of perfect&#xA;abstinence.&#xA;Seeing that Pandu was desirous of&#xA;offspring, which the rishi’s curse had&#xA;denied him, Kunti confided to him the&#xA;story of the mantra she had received from&#xA;Durvasa. He urged Kunti and Madri to use&#xA;the mantra and thus it was that the five&#xA;Pandavas were born of the gods to Kunti&#xA;and Madri.&#xA;They were born and brought up in the&#xA;forest among ascetics. King Pandu lived&#xA;for many years in the forest with his wives&#xA;and children. It was springtime. And one&#xA;day Pandu and Madri forgot their sorrows&#xA;in the rapture of sympathy with the&#xA;throbbing life around them, the happy&#xA;flowers, creepers, birds and other&#xA;creatures of the forest.&#xA;In spite of Madri’s earnest and repeated&#xA;protests Pandu’s resolution broke down&#xA;under the exhilarating influence of the&#xA;season, and at once the curse of the sage&#xA;took effect and Pandu fell, dead.&#xA;Madri could not contain her sorrow. Since&#xA;she felt that she was responsible for the&#xA;death of the king. She burnt herself on the&#xA;pyre of her husband entreating Kunti to&#xA;remain and be a mother to her doubly&#xA;orphaned children.&#xA;The sages of the forest took the bereaved&#xA;and grief-stricken Kunti and the Pandavas&#xA;to Hastinapura and entrusted them to&#xA;Bhishma.&#xA;Yudhishthira was but sixteen years old at&#xA;that time. When the sages came to&#xA;Hastinapura and reported the death of&#xA;Pandu in the forest, the whole kingdom&#xA;was plunged in sorrow. Vidura, Bhishma,&#xA;Vyasa, Dhritarashtra and others performed&#xA;the funeral rites.&#xA;All the people in the kingdom lamented as&#xA;at a personal loss. Vyasa said to Satyavati,&#xA;the grandmother: &amp;ldquo;The past has gone by&#xA;pleasantly, but the future has many&#xA;sorrows in store. The world has passed its&#xA;youth like a happy dream and it is now&#xA;entering on disillusionment, sin, sorrow&#xA;and suffering. Time is inexorable. You&#xA;need not wait to see the miseries and&#xA;misfortunes that will befall this race. It&#xA;will be good for you to leave the city and&#xA;spend the rest of your days in a hermitage&#xA;in the forest.&amp;rdquo; Satyavati agreed and went&#xA;to the forest with Ambika and Ambalika.&#xA;These three aged queens passed through&#xA;holy asceticism to the higher regions of&#xA;bliss and spared themselves the sorrows of&#xA;their children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE five sons of Pandu and the hundred&#xA;sons of Dhritarashtra grew up in mirth and&#xA;merriment at Hastinapura. Bhima excelled&#xA;them all in physical prowess. He used to&#xA;bully Duryodhana and the other Kauravas&#xA;by dragging them by the hair and beating&#xA;them.&#xA;A great swimmer, he would dive, into&#xA;pools, with one or more of them clasped&#xA;helpless in his arms, and remain under&#xA;water till they were almost drowned.&#xA;Whenever they climbed up on a tree he&#xA;would stand on the ground and kick at the&#xA;tree and shake them down like ripe fruits.&#xA;The bodies of the sons of Dhritarashtra&#xA;would be ever sore with bruises as a result&#xA;of Bhima&amp;rsquo;s practical jokes. Small wonder&#xA;that the sons of Dhritarashtra nursed a&#xA;deep hatred for Bhima from their very&#xA;infancy.&#xA;As the princes grew up. Kripacharya&#xA;taught them archery and the practice of&#xA;arms and other things that princes should&#xA;learn. Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s jealousy towards&#xA;Bhima warped his mind and made him&#xA;commit many improper acts.&#xA;Duryodhana was very much worried. His&#xA;father being blind, the kingdom was ruled&#xA;by Pandu. After his death Yudhishthira,&#xA;the heir-apparent, would in course of time&#xA;become king. Duryodhana thought that as&#xA;his blind father was quite helpless he&#xA;must, to prevent Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s accession&#xA;to the throne, contrive a way of killing&#xA;Bhima.&#xA;He made arrangements to carry out his&#xA;resolve since he thought that the powers&#xA;of the Pandavas would decline with the&#xA;death of Bhima.&#xA;Duryodhana and his brothers planned to&#xA;throw Bhima into the Ganges, imprison&#xA;Arjuna and Yudhishthira, and then seize&#xA;the kingdom and rule it. So Duryodhana&#xA;went with his brothers and the Pandavas&#xA;for a swim in the Ganges.&#xA;After the sports they slept in their tents&#xA;being exhausted. Bhima had exerted&#xA;himself more than the others and as his&#xA;food had been poisoned, he felt drowsy&#xA;and lay down on the bank of the river.&#xA;Duryodhana bound him with wild&#xA;creepers and threw him into the river.&#xA;The evil Duryodhana had already caused&#xA;sharp spikes to be planted on the spot.&#xA;This was done purposely so that Bhima&#xA;might in falling be impaled on the spikes,&#xA;and lose his life. Fortunately there was no&#xA;spike in the place where Bhima fell.&#xA;Poisonous water-snakes bit his body.&#xA;The poisonous food he had taken was&#xA;counteracted by the snake poison and&#xA;Bhima came to no harm, and presently,&#xA;the river washed him to a bank.&#xA;Duryodhana thought that Bhima must&#xA;have died as he had been thrown in the&#xA;river infested with poisonous snakes and&#xA;planted with spikes. So he returned to the&#xA;city with the rest of the party in great joy.&#xA;When Yudhishthira inquired about the&#xA;whereabouts of Bhima, Duryodhana&#xA;informed him that he had preceded them&#xA;to the city.&#xA;Yudhishthira believed Duryodhana and as&#xA;soon as he returned home, asked his&#xA;mother whether Bhima had returned&#xA;home.&#xA;His anxious question brought forth the&#xA;reply that Bhima had not yet returned,&#xA;which made Yudhishthira suspect some&#xA;foul play against his brother. And he went&#xA;again with his brothers to the forest and&#xA;searched everywhere. But Bhima could&#xA;not be found. They went back in great&#xA;sorrow.&#xA;Sometime later Bhima awoke and trudged&#xA;wearily&#xA;back&#xA;home.&#xA;Kunti&#xA;and&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;welcomed&#xA;him&#xA;and&#xA;embraced him in great joy. By the poison&#xA;that had entered his system Bhima became&#xA;stronger than before.Kunti sent for Vidura and told him in&#xA;secret:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Duryodhana is wicked and cruel. He&#xA;seeks to kill Bhima since he wants to rule&#xA;the kingdom. I am worried.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vidura replied: &amp;ldquo;What you say is true, but&#xA;keep your thoughts to yourself. For if the&#xA;wicked Duryodhana is accused or blamed,&#xA;his anger and hatred will only increase.&#xA;Your sons are blessed with long life. You&#xA;need have no fear on that account.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira also warned Bhima and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Be silent over the matter. Hereafter, we&#xA;have to be careful and help one another&#xA;and protect ourselves.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana was surprised to see Bhima&#xA;come back alive. His jealousy and hatred&#xA;increased. He heaved a deep sigh and&#xA;pined away in sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE Pandavas and the Kauravas learnt&#xA;the practice of arms first&#xA;from&#xA;Kripacharya and later from Drona. A day&#xA;was fixed for a test and exhibition of their&#xA;proficiency in the use of arms in the&#xA;presence of the royal family and as the&#xA;public had also been invited to witness the&#xA;performance of their beloved princes.&#xA;There was a large and enthusiastic crowd.&#xA;Arjuna displayed superhuman skill with&#xA;his weapons and the vast assemblage was&#xA;lost&#xA;in&#xA;wonder&#xA;and&#xA;admiration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DRONA, the son of a brahmana named&#xA;Bharadwaja, after completing his study of&#xA;the Vedas and the Vedangas, devoted&#xA;himself to the art of archery and became a&#xA;great master.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drupada, the son of the king of Panchala,&#xA;who was a friend of Bharadwaja, was a&#xA;fellow-student of Drona in the hermitage&#xA;and there grew up between them the&#xA;generous intimacy of youth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drupada, in his boyish enthusiasm, used&#xA;often to tell Drona that he would give him&#xA;half his kingdom when he ascended the&#xA;throne. After completing his studies,&#xA;Drona married the sister of Kripa, and a&#xA;son Aswatthama was born to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE jealousy of Duryodhana began to&#xA;grow at the sight of the physical strength&#xA;of Bhima and the dexterity of Arjuna.&#xA;Karna and Sakuni became Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;evil&#xA;counsellors&#xA;in&#xA;planning&#xA;wily&#xA;stratagems.&#xA;As for poor Dhritarashtra, he was a wise&#xA;man no doubt and he also loved his&#xA;brother&amp;rsquo;s sons, but he was weak of will&#xA;and dotingly attached to his own children.&#xA;For his children&amp;rsquo;s sake the worse became&#xA;the better reason, and he would sometimes&#xA;even knowingly follow the wrong path.&#xA;Duryodhana sought in various ways to kill&#xA;the Pandavas. It was by means of the&#xA;secret help rendered by Vidura who&#xA;wanted to save the family from a great sin,&#xA;that the Pandavas escaped with their lives.&#xA;One unforgivable offence of the Pandavas&#xA;in the eyes of Duryodhana was that the&#xA;people of the city used to praise them&#xA;openly and declare in season and out of&#xA;season that Yudhishthira alone was fit to&#xA;be the king.&#xA;They would flock together and argue:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dhritarashtra could never be king for he&#xA;was born blind. It is not proper that he&#xA;should now hold the kingdom in his&#xA;hands. Bhishma cannot be king either,&#xA;because he is devoted to truth and to his&#xA;vow that he would not be a king. Hence&#xA;Yudhishthira alone should be crowned as&#xA;king. He alone can rule the Kuru race and&#xA;the kingdom with justice.&amp;rdquo; Thus people&#xA;talked everywhere. These words were&#xA;poison to Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s ears, and made&#xA;him writhe and burn with jealousy.He went to Dhritarashtra and complained&#xA;bitterly of the public talk: &amp;ldquo;Father, the&#xA;citizens babble irrelevant nonsense. They&#xA;have no respect even for such venerable&#xA;persons as Bhishma and yourself. They&#xA;say&#xA;that&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;should&#xA;be&#xA;immediately crowned king. This would&#xA;bring disaster on us. You were set aside&#xA;because of your blindness, and your&#xA;brother became the king. If Yudhishthira&#xA;is to succeed his father, where do we&#xA;come? What chance has our progeny?&#xA;After Yudhishthira his son, and his son&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;son, and then his son will be the kings.&#xA;We will sink into poor relations dependent&#xA;on them even for our food. To live in hell&#xA;would be better than that!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At these words, Dhritarashtra began to&#xA;ponder and said: &amp;ldquo;Son, what you say is&#xA;true. Still Yudhishthira will not stray from&#xA;the path of virtue. He loves all. He has&#xA;truly inherited all the excellent virtues of&#xA;his deceased father. People praise him and&#xA;will support him, and all the ministers of&#xA;the State and commanders of armies, to&#xA;whom Pandu had endeared himself by his&#xA;nobility of character, will surely espouse&#xA;his cause. As for the people, they idolise&#xA;the Pandavas. We cannot oppose them&#xA;with any chance of success. If we do&#xA;injustice, the citizens will rise in&#xA;insurrection and either kill us or expel us.&#xA;We shall only cover ourselves with&#xA;ignominy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana replied: &amp;ldquo;Your fears are&#xA;baseless. Bhishma will at worst be neutral,&#xA;while Ashwatthama is devoted to me,&#xA;which means that his father Drona and&#xA;uncle Kripa will also be on our side.&#xA;Vidura cannot openly oppose us, if for no&#xA;other reason, because he has not the&#xA;strength. Send the Pandavas immediately&#xA;to Varanavata. I tell you the solemn truth&#xA;that my cup of suffering is full and I can&#xA;bear no more. It pierces my heart and&#xA;renders me sleepless and makes my life a&#xA;torment. After sending the Pandavas to&#xA;Varanavata we shall try to strengthen our&#xA;party.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Later, some politicians were prevailed&#xA;upon to join Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s party and&#xA;advise the king in the matter. Kanika, the&#xA;minister of Sakuni, was their leader. &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;king,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;guard yourselves against&#xA;the sons of Pandu, for their goodness and&#xA;influence are a menace to you and yours.&#xA;The Pandavas are the sons of your&#xA;brother, but the nearer the kin, the closer&#xA;and deadlier the danger. They are very&#xA;strong.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sakuni&amp;rsquo;s minister continued: &amp;ldquo;Be not&#xA;wroth with me if I say a king should be&#xA;mighty in action as in name, for nobody&#xA;will believe in strength which is never&#xA;displayed. State affairs should be kept&#xA;secret and the earliest indication to the&#xA;public, of a wise plan, should be its&#xA;execution. Also, evils must be eradicated&#xA;promptly for a thorn which has been&#xA;allowed to remain in the body may cause&#xA;a festering wound. Powerful enemies&#xA;should be destroyed and even a weak foe&#xA;should not be neglected since a mere&#xA;spark, if over looked, may cause a forest&#xA;fire. A strong enemy should be destroyed&#xA;by means of stratagem and it would be&#xA;folly to show mercy to him. O king, guard&#xA;yourself against the sons of Pandu. They&#xA;are very powerful.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana told Dhritarashtra of his&#xA;success in securing adherents: &amp;ldquo;I have&#xA;bought the goodwill of the king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;attendants with gifts of wealth and honor.&#xA;I have won over his ministers to our&#xA;cause. If you will adroitly prevail upon the&#xA;Pandavas to go to Varanavata, the city and&#xA;the whole kingdom will take our side.&#xA;They will not have a friend left here. Once&#xA;the kingdom has become ours, there will&#xA;be no power for harm left in them, and it&#xA;may even be possible to let them come&#xA;back.&amp;ldquo;When many began to say what he himself&#xA;wished to believe, Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s mind&#xA;was shaken and he yielded to his sons&#39;&#xA;counsels. It only remained to give effect&#xA;to the plot.&#xA;The ministers began to praise the beauty&#xA;of Varanavata in the hearing of the&#xA;Pandavas and made mention of the fact&#xA;that a great festival in honor of Siva&#xA;would be conducted there with all pomp&#xA;and splendor.&#xA;The unsuspecting Pandavas were easily&#xA;persuaded, especially when Dhritarashtra&#xA;also told them in tones of great affection&#xA;that they should certainly go and witness&#xA;the festivities, not only because they were&#xA;worth seeing but because the people of the&#xA;place were eager to welcome them.&#xA;The Pandavas took leave of Bhishma and&#xA;other elders and went to Varanavata.&#xA;Duryodhana was elated. He plotted with&#xA;Karna and Sakuni to kill Kunti and her&#xA;sons at Varanavata. They sent for&#xA;Purochana, a minister, and gave him&#xA;secret instructions which he bound&#xA;himself to carry out faithfully.&#xA;Before the Pandavas proceeded to&#xA;Varanavata, Purochana, true to his&#xA;instructions, hastened to the spot well in&#xA;advance and had a beautiful palace built&#xA;for their reception. Combustible materials&#xA;like jute, lac, ghee, oil, and fat were used&#xA;in the construction of the palace. The&#xA;materials for the plastering of the walls&#xA;were also inflammable. He skilfully filled&#xA;up various parts of the building with dry&#xA;things that could catch fire easily, and had&#xA;inviting seats and bedsteads disposed at&#xA;the most combustible places.&#xA;Every convenience was furnished for the&#xA;Pandavas to dwell in the city without fear,&#xA;until the palace was built. When the&#xA;Pandavas had settled down in the wax&#xA;house, the idea was to set fire to it at night&#xA;when they were sound asleep.&#xA;The ostentatious love and solicitude with&#xA;which the Pandavas had been received&#xA;and treated would obviate all suspicion&#xA;and the fire would be taken as a sad case&#xA;of pure accident. No one would dream of&#xA;blaming the Kauravas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AFTER taking reverential leave of the&#xA;elders and embracing their comrades, the&#xA;Pandavas proceeded to Varanavata. The&#xA;citizens accompanied them a part of their&#xA;way and returned unwillingly to the city.&#xA;Vidura pointedly warned Yudhishthira in&#xA;words intelligible only to the prince:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;He alone will escape from danger who&#xA;forestalls the intentions of an astute&#xA;enemy. There are weapons sharper than&#xA;those made of steel. And the wise man&#xA;who would escape destruction must know&#xA;the means to guard against them. The&#xA;conflagration that devastates a forest&#xA;cannot hurt a rat which shelters itself in a&#xA;hole or a porcupine which burrows in the&#xA;earth. The wise man knows his bearings&#xA;by looking at the stars.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Though they had started on their journey&#xA;in sunshine of joy, they now proceeded in&#xA;a dark cloud of sorrow and anxiety.&#xA;The people of Varanavata were very&#xA;happy to learn of the coming of the&#xA;Pandavas to their city and welcomed&#xA;them. After a brief stay in other houses&#xA;while the palace specially meant for them&#xA;was being got ready, they moved into it&#xA;under Purochana&amp;rsquo;s guidance.&#xA;It was named &amp;ldquo;Sivam&amp;rdquo; which means&#xA;prosperity, and that was the name which,&#xA;in ghastly irony, was given to the&#xA;deathtrap.&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;diligently&#xA;examined the whole place bearing in mind&#xA;Vidura&amp;rsquo;s warning and verified that the&#xA;building was without a shadow of doubt&#xA;constructed with combustible material.&#xA;Yudhishthira told Bhima: &amp;ldquo;Though we&#xA;know very well that the palace is a trap ofdeath, we should not make Purochana&#xA;suspect that we know his plot. We should&#xA;get away at the right moment but escape&#xA;would be difficult if we gave room for any&#xA;suspicion.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So they stayed in that house to all&#xA;appearance free from care. Meanwhile,&#xA;Vidura had sent an expert miner who met&#xA;them in secret and said: &amp;ldquo;My password is&#xA;the veiled warning Vidura gave you. I&#xA;have been sent to help you for your&#xA;protection.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This was meant to indicate to&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;and&#xA;to&#xA;him&#xA;alone,&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s hideous plot and the means&#xA;of escape from danger. Yudhishthira&#xA;answered that he had grasped Vidura&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;meaning, and later he communicated it to&#xA;Kuntidevi.&#xA;Henceforward the miner worked for many&#xA;days in secret, unknown to Purochana,&#xA;and completed a subterranean egress from&#xA;the wax house right under and across the&#xA;walls and the moat, which ran round the&#xA;precincts.&#xA;Purochana had his quarters at the gateway&#xA;of the palace. The Pandavas kept armed&#xA;vigil during night, but by day they used to&#xA;go out hunting in the forest, to all&#xA;appearance bent on pleasure but really to&#xA;make themselves familiar with the forest&#xA;paths.&#xA;As has already been said, they carefully&#xA;kept to themselves their knowledge of the&#xA;wicked plot against their lives. On his side&#xA;Purochana, anxious to lull all suspicion&#xA;and make the murderous fire seem an&#xA;accident, waited fully a year before&#xA;putting the plot into effect.&#xA;At last Purochana felt he had waited long&#xA;enough. And the watchful Yudhishthira,&#xA;knowing that the fated moment had&#xA;arrived, called his brothers together and&#xA;told them that now or never was the time&#xA;for them to escape.&#xA;Kuntidevi arranged a sumptuous feast for&#xA;the attendants that day. Her idea was to&#xA;lull them to well-fed sleep at night.&#xA;At midnight, Bhima set fire to the palace&#xA;in several places. Kuntidevi and the&#xA;Pandava brothers hurried out through the&#xA;subterranean passage, groping their way&#xA;out in the darkness. Presently, there was a&#xA;roaring fire all over the palace and a fast&#xA;swelling crowd of frightened citizens all&#xA;around in loud and helpless lamentation.&#xA;Some bustled aimlessly in futile efforts to&#xA;put out the conflagration and all joined in&#xA;the cry: &amp;ldquo;Alas! Alas! This surely is&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s work, and he is killing the&#xA;sinless Pandavas!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The palace was reduced to ashes.&#xA;Purochana&amp;rsquo;s residence was enveloped in&#xA;flames before he could escape and he fell&#xA;an unpitied victim to his own wicked plot.&#xA;The people of Varanavata, sent the&#xA;following message to Hastinapura: &amp;ldquo;The&#xA;palace which was the abode of the&#xA;Pandavas has burnt down and no one in it&#xA;escaped alive.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vyasa has beautifully described the then&#xA;mental state of Dhritarashtra: &amp;ldquo;Just as the&#xA;water of a deep pool is cool at the bottom&#xA;and warm on the surface, so the heart of&#xA;Dhritarashtra was at once warm with joy&#xA;and chilled with sorrow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhritarashtra and his sons cast off their&#xA;royal garments in token of mourning for&#xA;the Pandavas whom they believed&#xA;consumed in the fire. They dressed&#xA;themselves in single garments as became&#xA;sorrowful kinsmen and went to the river&#xA;and performed the propitiatory funeral&#xA;rites.&#xA;No outward show of heart broken&#xA;bereavement was omitted. It was noticed&#xA;by some that Vidura was not so overcome&#xA;by sorrow as the others and this was set&#xA;down to his philosophical bent of mind.&#xA;But the real reason was that he knew that&#xA;the Pandavas had escaped to safety.When he looked sad, he was in fact&#xA;following with his mind&amp;rsquo;s eye the weary&#xA;wanderings of the Pandavas. Seeing that&#xA;Bhishma was sunk in sorrow, Vidura&#xA;secretly comforted him by revealing to&#xA;him the story of their successful escape.&#xA;Bhima saw that his mother and brothers&#xA;were exhausted by their nightly vigils as&#xA;well as by fear and anxiety. He therefore&#xA;carried his mother on his shoulders and&#xA;took Nakula and Sahadeva on his hips,&#xA;supporting Yudhishthira and Arjuna with&#xA;his two hands.&#xA;Thus heavily laden, he strode effortlessly&#xA;like a lordly elephant forcing his way&#xA;through the forest and pushing aside the&#xA;shrubs and trees that obstructed his path.&#xA;When they reached the Ganges, there was&#xA;a boat ready for them in charge of a&#xA;boatman who knew their secret. They&#xA;crossed the river in the darkness, and&#xA;entering a mighty forest they went on at&#xA;night in darkness that wrapped them like a&#xA;shroud and in a silence broken hideously&#xA;by the frightful noises of wild animals.&#xA;At last, quite fordone by toil, they sat&#xA;down unable to bear the pangs of thirst&#xA;and overcome by the drowsiness of sheer&#xA;fatigue. Kuntidevi said: &amp;ldquo;I do not care&#xA;even if the sons of Dhritarashtra are here&#xA;to seize me, but I must stretch my legs.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She forthwith laid herself down and was&#xA;sunk in sleep.&#xA;Bhima forced his way about the tangled&#xA;forest in search of water in the darkness.&#xA;And finding a pool, he wetted his upper&#xA;garment, made cups of lotus leaves and&#xA;brought water to his mother and brothers&#xA;who were perishing with thirst.&#xA;Then, while the others slept in merciful&#xA;forgetfulness of their woes, Bhima alone&#xA;sat awake absorbed in deep thought. &amp;ldquo;Do&#xA;not the plants and the creepers of the&#xA;forest mutually help each other and live in&#xA;peace?&amp;rdquo; he reflected; &amp;ldquo;why should the&#xA;wicked Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana try&#xA;to injure us in these ways?&amp;rdquo; Sinless&#xA;himself, Bhima could not understand the&#xA;springs of sinfulness in others and was&#xA;lost in grief.&#xA;The Pandavas marched on, suffering&#xA;many hardships and overcoming many&#xA;dangers. Part of the way, they would carry&#xA;their mother to make better speed.&#xA;Sometimes, tired beyond even heroic&#xA;endurance, they would pause and rest.&#xA;Sometimes, full of life and the glorious&#xA;strength of youth, they would race with&#xA;each other.&#xA;They met Bhagavan Vyasa on the way.&#xA;All of them bowed before him and&#xA;received encouragement and wise counsel&#xA;from him.&#xA;When Kunti told him of the sorrows that&#xA;had befallen them, Vyasa consoled her&#xA;with these words: &amp;ldquo;No virtuous man is&#xA;strong enough to live in virtue at all times,&#xA;nor is any sinner bad enough to exist in&#xA;one welter of sin. Life is a tangled web&#xA;and there is no one in the world who has&#xA;not done both good and evil. Each and&#xA;everyone has to bear the consequence of&#xA;his actions. Do not give way to sorrow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then they put on the garb of brahmanas,&#xA;as advised by Vyasa, went to the city of&#xA;Ekachakra and stayed there in a&#xA;brahmana&amp;rsquo;s house, waiting for better days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IN the city of Ekachakra, the Pandavas&#xA;stayed in the guise of brahmanas, begging&#xA;their food in the brahmana streets and&#xA;bringing what they got to their mother,&#xA;who would wait anxiously till their return.&#xA;If they did not come back in time, she&#xA;would be worried, fearing that some evil&#xA;might have befallen them.&#xA;Kunti would divide the food they brought&#xA;in two equal portions. One half would go&#xA;to Bhima. The other half would be shared&#xA;by the other brothers and the mother.&#xA;Bhima, being born of the Wind god had&#xA;great strength and a mighty appetite.Vrikodara, one of the names of Bhima,&#xA;means wolf-bellied, and a wolf, you&#xA;know, looks always famished. And&#xA;however much it might eat, its hunger is&#xA;never quite satisfied.&#xA;Bhima&amp;rsquo;s insatiable hunger and the scanty&#xA;food he used to get at Ekachakra went ill&#xA;together. And he daily grew thin, which&#xA;caused much distress to his mother and&#xA;brothers. Sometime later, Bhima became&#xA;acquainted with a potter for whom he&#xA;helped and fetched clay. The potter, in&#xA;return, presented him with a big earthen&#xA;pot that became an object of merriment to&#xA;the street urchins.&#xA;One day, when the other brothers had&#xA;gone to beg for alms, Bhimasena stayed&#xA;behind with his mother, and they heard&#xA;loud lamentations from the house of their&#xA;brahmana landlord. Some great calamity&#xA;surely had befallen the poor family and&#xA;Kunti went inside to learn what it was.&#xA;The brahmana and his wife could hardly&#xA;speak for weeping, but, at last the&#xA;brahmana said to his wife: &amp;ldquo;O unfortunate&#xA;and foolish woman, though time and again&#xA;I wished we should leave this city for&#xA;good, you would not agree. You persisted&#xA;in saying that you were born and bred&#xA;here and here you would stay where your&#xA;parents and relations had lived and died.&#xA;How can I think of losing you who have&#xA;been to me at once my life&amp;rsquo;s mate, loving&#xA;mother, the wife who bore my children,&#xA;nay, my all in all? I cannot send you to&#xA;death while I keep myself alive. This little&#xA;girl has been given to us by God as a trust&#xA;to be handed over in time to a worthy&#xA;man. It is unrighteous to sacrifice her who&#xA;is a gift of God to perpetuate the race. It is&#xA;equally impossible to allow this other, our&#xA;son, to be killed. How can we live after&#xA;consigning to death our only solace in life&#xA;and our hope for the here after? If he is&#xA;lost, who would pour libations for us and&#xA;our ancestors? Alas! You did not pay heed&#xA;to my words, and this is the deadly fruit of&#xA;your perversity. If I give up my life, this&#xA;girl and boy will surely die soon for want&#xA;of a protector. What shall I do? It is best&#xA;that all of us perish together&amp;rdquo; and the&#xA;brahmana burst forth sobbing.&#xA;The wife replied: &amp;ldquo;I have been a good&#xA;wife to you, and done my duty by bearing&#xA;you a daughter and a son. You are able,&#xA;and I am not, to bring up and protect your&#xA;children. Just as cast out offal is pounced&#xA;upon and seized by rapacious birds, a poor&#xA;widowed woman is an easy prey to&#xA;wicked and dishonest people. Dogs fight&#xA;for a cloth wet with ghee, and in pulling it&#xA;hither and thither in unclean greed, tear it&#xA;into foul rags. It would be best if I am&#xA;handed over to the Rakshasa. Blessed&#xA;indeed is the woman who passes to the&#xA;other world, while her husband is alive.&#xA;This, as you know, is what the scriptures&#xA;say. Bid me farewell. Take care of my&#xA;children. I have been happy with you. I&#xA;have performed many meritorious actions.&#xA;By my faithful devotion to you, I am sure&#xA;of heaven. Death has no terror for one&#xA;who has been a good wife. After I am&#xA;gone, take another wife. Gladden me with&#xA;a brave smile, give me your blessing, and&#xA;send me to the Rakshasa.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing these words of his wife, the&#xA;brahmana tenderly embraced her and,&#xA;utterly overcome by her love and courage,&#xA;he wept like a child. When he could find&#xA;his voice, he replied: &amp;ldquo;O beloved and&#xA;noble one, what words are these? Can I&#xA;bear to live without you? The first duty of&#xA;a married man is to protect his wife. I&#xA;should indeed be a pitiful sinner if I lived&#xA;after giving you up to the Rakshasa,&#xA;sacrificing both love and duty.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The daughter who was hearing this&#xA;piteous conversation, now interposed with&#xA;sobs: &amp;ldquo;Listen to me, child though I be, and&#xA;then do what is proper. It is me alone that&#xA;you can spare to the Rakshasa. Bysacrificing one soul, that is, myself, you&#xA;can save the others. Let me be the little&#xA;boat to take you across this river of&#xA;calamity. In like manner, a woman&#xA;without a guardian becomes the sport of&#xA;wicked people who drag her hither and&#xA;thither. It is impossible for me to protect&#xA;two fatherless orphans and they will&#xA;perish miserably like fish in a waterless&#xA;pond. If both of you pass away, both I and&#xA;this little baby brother of mine will soon&#xA;perish unprotected in this hard world. If&#xA;this family of ours can be saved from&#xA;destruction by my single death, what a&#xA;good death mine would be! Even if you&#xA;consider my welfare alone, you should&#xA;send me to the Rakshasa.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At these brave words of the poor child, the&#xA;parents tenderly embraced her and wept.&#xA;Seeing them all in tears the boy, hardly&#xA;more than a baby, started up with glowing&#xA;eyes, lisping: &amp;ldquo;Father, do not weep.&#xA;Mother, do not weep. Sister, do not&#xA;weep,&amp;rdquo; and he went to each and sat on&#xA;their lap by turns.&#xA;Then he rose up took a stick of firewood&#xA;and brandishing it about, said in his sweet&#xA;childish treble: &amp;ldquo;I shall kill the Rakshasa&#xA;with this stick.&amp;rdquo; The child&amp;rsquo;s action and&#xA;speech made them smile in the midst of&#xA;their tears, but only added to their great&#xA;sorrow.&#xA;Feeling this was the moment for&#xA;intervention,&#xA;Kuntidevi&#xA;entered&#xA;and&#xA;inquired for the cause of their sorrow and&#xA;whether there was anything she could do&#xA;to help them.&#xA;The brahmana said: &amp;ldquo;Mother, this is a&#xA;sorrow far beyond your aid. There is a&#xA;cave near the city, where lives a cruel and&#xA;terribly strong Rakshasa named Bakasura.&#xA;He forcibly seized this city and kingdom&#xA;thirteen years ago. Since then he has held&#xA;us in cruel thraldom. The kshatriya ruler&#xA;of this country has fled to the city of&#xA;Vetrakiya and is unable to protect us. This&#xA;Rakshasa formerly used to issue from his&#xA;cave whenever he liked and, mad with&#xA;hunger, indiscriminately kill and eat men,&#xA;women and children in this city. The&#xA;citizens prayed to the Rakshasa to come to&#xA;some sort of stipulation in place of this&#xA;promiscuous slaughter. They prayed: &amp;lsquo;Do&#xA;not kill us wantonly at your whim and&#xA;pleasure. Once a week we shall bring you&#xA;sufficient&#xA;meat,&#xA;rice,&#xA;curds&#xA;and&#xA;intoxicating liquors and many other&#xA;delicacies. We will deliver these to you in&#xA;a carriage drawn by two bullocks driven&#xA;by a human being taken from each house&#xA;in turn. You can make a repast of the rice,&#xA;along with the bullocks and the man, but&#xA;refrain from this mad orgy of slaughter.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;The Rakshasa agreed to the proposal.&#xA;From that day, this strong Rakshasa has&#xA;been protecting this kingdom from foreign&#xA;raids and wild beasts. This arrangement&#xA;has been in force for many years. No hero&#xA;has been found to free this country from&#xA;this pest, for the Rakshasa has invariably&#xA;defeated and killed all the brave men who&#xA;tried. Mother, our legitimate sovereign is&#xA;unable to protect us. The citizens of a&#xA;country, whose king is weak, should not&#xA;marry and beget children. A worthy&#xA;family life, with culture and domestic&#xA;happiness, is possible only under the rule&#xA;of a good, strong king. Wife, wealth and&#xA;other things are not safe, if there be no&#xA;proper king ruling over us. And having&#xA;long suffered with the sight of others&#39;&#xA;sorrow, our own turn has come now to&#xA;send a person as prey to the Rakshasa. I&#xA;have not the means to purchase a&#xA;substitute. None of us can bear to live&#xA;after sending one of us to a cruel death,&#xA;and so I shall go with my whole family to&#xA;him. Let the wicked glutton gorge himself&#xA;with all of us. I have pained you with&#xA;these things, but you wished to know.&#xA;Only God can help us, but we have lost all&#xA;hope even of that.&amp;ldquo;The political truths contained in this story&#xA;of Ekachakra are noteworthy and&#xA;suggestive. Kunti talked the matter over&#xA;with Bhimasena and returned to the&#xA;brahmana. She said: &amp;ldquo;Good man, do not&#xA;despair. God is great. I have five sons.&#xA;One of them will take the food to the&#xA;Rakshasa.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The brahmana jumped up in amazed&#xA;surprise, but then shook his head sadly&#xA;and would not hear of the substituted&#xA;sacrifice. Kunti said: &amp;ldquo;O brahmana, do not&#xA;be afraid. My son is endowed with&#xA;superhuman powers derived from mantras&#xA;and will certainly kill this Rakshasa, as I&#xA;have myself seen him kill many other&#xA;such Rakshasas. But keep this a secret,&#xA;for, if you reveal it, his power will come&#xA;to naught.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kunti&amp;rsquo;s fear was that, if the story got&#xA;noised abroad, Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s men would&#xA;see the hand of the Pandavas, and find out&#xA;their where abouts. Bhima was filled with&#xA;unbounded joy and enthusiasm at the&#xA;arrangement made by Kunti.&#xA;The other brothers returned to the house&#xA;with alms. Dharmaputra saw the face of&#xA;Bhimasena radiant with joy to which it&#xA;had long been a stranger and inferred that&#xA;he was resolved on some hazardous&#xA;adventure and questioned Kunti who told&#xA;him everything.&#xA;Yudhishthira said: &amp;ldquo;What is this? Is not&#xA;this rash and thoughtless? Relying on&#xA;Bhima&amp;rsquo;s strength we sleep without care or&#xA;fear. It is not through Bhima&amp;rsquo;s strength&#xA;and daring that we hope to regain the&#xA;kingdom that has been seized by our&#xA;deceitful enemies? Was it not through the&#xA;prowess of Bhima that we escaped from&#xA;the wax palace? And you are risking the&#xA;life of Bhima who is our present&#xA;protection and future hope. I fear your&#xA;many trials have clouded your judgment!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kuntidevi replied: &amp;ldquo;Dear sons, we have&#xA;lived happily for many years in the house&#xA;of this brahmana. Duty, nay, man&amp;rsquo;s highest&#xA;virtue, is to repay the benefit he has&#xA;enjoyed by doing good in his turn. I know&#xA;the heroism of Bhima and have no fears.&#xA;Remember&#xA;who&#xA;carried&#xA;us&#xA;from&#xA;Varanavata and who killed the demon&#xA;Hidimba. It is our duty to be of service to&#xA;this brahmana family.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After a fierce battle, the Rakshasa&#xA;Bakasura was slain by Bhima who&#xA;pretended to bring him a cartload of food.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHILE the Pandavas were living in&#xA;disguise as brahmanas at Ekachakrapura,&#xA;news of the swayamvara of Draupadi, the&#xA;daughter of Drupada, King of Panchala,&#xA;reached them. Many brahmanas of&#xA;Ekachakrapura planned to go to Panchala&#xA;in the hope of receiving the customary&#xA;gifts and to see the festivities and pageant&#xA;of a royal wedding. Kunti, with her&#xA;motherly instinct, read her sons&amp;rsquo; desire to&#xA;go to Panchala and win Draupadi. So she&#xA;told Yudhishthira: &amp;ldquo;We have been in this&#xA;city so long that it is time to think of&#xA;going somewhere else. We have seen&#xA;these hills and dales till we are tired of&#xA;them. The alms doled out to us are&#xA;diminishing and it is not good to outstay&#xA;your entertainment. Let us therefore go to&#xA;Drupada&amp;rsquo;s kingdom which is reputed to be&#xA;fair and prosperous.&amp;rdquo; Kunti was second to&#xA;none in worldly wisdom and sagacity and&#xA;could gracefully divine her sons&amp;rsquo; thoughts&#xA;and spare them the awkwardness of&#xA;expressing them.&#xA;The brahmanas went in groups to witness&#xA;the swayamvara and the Pandavas&#xA;mingled with them in the guise of&#xA;brahmanas. After a long march the party&#xA;reached the beautiful city of Drupada and&#xA;billeted themselves in the house of a&#xA;potter as obscure brahmanas of no note.&#xA;Though Drupada and Drona were&#xA;outwardly at peace, the former never&#xA;could forget or forgive the humiliation hehad suffered at the latter&amp;rsquo;s hands.&#xA;Drupada&amp;rsquo;s one wish was to give his&#xA;daughter in marriage to Arjuna.&#xA;Drona loved Arjuna so dearly that he&#xA;could hardly look upon his pupil&amp;rsquo;s father-&#xA;in-law as his deadly foe. And if there were&#xA;a war, Drupada would be all the stronger&#xA;for being Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s father-in-law. When he&#xA;heard the news of the destruction of the&#xA;Pandavas at Varanavata, he was plunged&#xA;in sorrow but was relieved by a later&#xA;rumour that they had escaped.&#xA;The marriage hall was beautifully&#xA;decorated and built amidst a finely laid&#xA;out group of new guest-houses designed&#xA;to accommodate the swayamvara suitors&#xA;and guests. Attractive sights and sports&#xA;had&#xA;been&#xA;arranged&#xA;for&#xA;public&#xA;entertainment and there were glorious&#xA;festivities for fourteen days continuously.&#xA;A mighty steel bow was placed in the&#xA;marriage hall. The candidate for the&#xA;princess&amp;rsquo; hand was required to string the&#xA;bow and with it shoot a steel arrow&#xA;through the central aperture of a revolving&#xA;disk at a target placed on high.&#xA;This required almost superhuman strength&#xA;and skill, and Drupada proclaimed that the&#xA;hero who would win his daughter should&#xA;perform this feat. Many valiant princes&#xA;had gathered there from all parts of&#xA;Bharatavarsha. The sons of Dhritarashtra&#xA;were there as well as Karna, Krishna,&#xA;Sisupala, Jarasandha, and Salya.&#xA;Besides the competitors there was a huge&#xA;concourse of spectators and visitors. The&#xA;noise that issued therefrom resembled the&#xA;uproar of the ocean and over it all arose&#xA;the auspicious sound of festal music from&#xA;hundreds of instruments.&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna on horseback rode in&#xA;front of his sister Draupadi seated on an&#xA;elephant. Fresh from her auspicious bridal&#xA;bath, and clad in flowing silk Draupadi&#xA;dismounted and entered the swayamvara&#xA;hall, seeming to fill it with the sweetness&#xA;of her presence and perfect beauty.&#xA;Garland in hand, and coyly glancing at the&#xA;valiant princes, who for their part looked&#xA;at her in speechless admiration, she&#xA;ascended the dais. The brahmanas&#xA;repeated the usual mantras and offered&#xA;oblations in the fire. After the peace&#xA;invocation had been chanted and the&#xA;flourish&#xA;of&#xA;music&#xA;had&#xA;stopped,&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna took Draupadi by the&#xA;hand and led her to the center of the hall.&#xA;Then he proclaimed in loud, clear tones:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Hear ye, O princes seated in state in this&#xA;assembly, here is the bow. There is the&#xA;target and here are the arrows. He who&#xA;sends five arrows in succession through&#xA;the hole of the wheel and unerringly hits&#xA;the target, if he also be of good family and&#xA;presence, shall win my sister.&amp;rdquo; Then he&#xA;narrated to Draupadi the name, ancestry&#xA;and description of the several suitors&#xA;assembled there.&#xA;Many noted princes rose one after another&#xA;and tried in vain to string the bow. It was&#xA;too heavy and stiff for them, and they&#xA;returned to their places abashed and&#xA;ashamed.&#xA;Sisupala,&#xA;Jarasandha,&#xA;Salya,&#xA;and&#xA;Duryodhana&#xA;were&#xA;among&#xA;these&#xA;unsuccessful aspirants. When Karna came&#xA;forward, all the assemblage expected that&#xA;he would be successful but he failed by&#xA;just a hair&amp;rsquo;s breadth and the string slid&#xA;back flashing and the mighty bow jumped&#xA;out of his hands like a thing of life.&#xA;There was great clamor and angry talk,&#xA;some even saying that it was an&#xA;impossible test put up to shame the kings.&#xA;Then all noises were hushed, for there&#xA;arose from among the group of brahmanas&#xA;a youth who advanced towards the bow.&#xA;It was Arjuna who had come disguised as&#xA;a brahmana. When he stood up; wild&#xA;clamor burst forth again from the crowd.&#xA;The brahmanas themselves were dividedin opinion. Some being highly delighted&#xA;that there should be among them a lad of&#xA;mettle enough to compete, while others&#xA;more envious or worldly wise, said what&#xA;impudence it was for this brahmacharin to&#xA;enter the lists when heroes like Karna,&#xA;Salya, and others had met with failure.&#xA;But there were others again who spoke&#xA;differently as they noted the noble and&#xA;shapely proportions of the youth. They&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;We feel from his appearance that he&#xA;is going to win. He looks sure of himself&#xA;and he certainly knows what he is about.&#xA;The brahmana may be physically weaker,&#xA;but is it all a matter of brute strength?&#xA;What about the power of austerities? Why&#xA;should he not try?&amp;rdquo; And they blessed him.&#xA;Arjuna approached the place where the&#xA;bow lay and asked Dhrishtadyumna: &amp;ldquo;Can&#xA;a brahmana try to bend the bow?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna answered: &amp;ldquo;O best of&#xA;brahmanas, my sister will become the life-&#xA;mate of any one of good family and&#xA;presence, who bends the bow and shoots&#xA;the target. My words stand and there will&#xA;be no going back on them.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Arjuna meditated on Narayana, the&#xA;Supreme God, and took the bow in his&#xA;hand and strung it with ease. He placed an&#xA;arrow on the string and looked around him&#xA;with a smile, while the crowd was lost in&#xA;spellbound silence.&#xA;Then without pause or hesitation he shot&#xA;five arrows in succession through the&#xA;revolving mechanism right into the target&#xA;so that it fell down. The crowd was in&#xA;tumult and there was a blare of musical&#xA;instruments.&#xA;The brahmanas who were seated in the&#xA;assembly in large numbers sent forth&#xA;shouts of joy, waving aloft their deer-&#xA;skins in exultation as though the whole&#xA;community had won Draupadi. The&#xA;uproar that followed was indescribable.&#xA;Draupadi shone with a fresh beauty. Her&#xA;face glowed with happiness which&#xA;streamed out of her eyes as she looked on&#xA;Arjuna. She approached him and placed&#xA;the garland on his neck. Yudhishthira,&#xA;Nakula, and Sahadeva returned in haste to&#xA;the potter&amp;rsquo;s house to convey the glad news&#xA;immediately to their mother.&#xA;Bhima alone remained in the assembly&#xA;fearing that some danger might befall&#xA;Arjuna from the kshatriyas. As anticipated&#xA;by Bhima, the princes were loud in wrath.&#xA;They said: &amp;ldquo;The practice of swayamvara,&#xA;the choosing of a bridegroom, is not&#xA;prevalent among the brahmanas. If this&#xA;maiden does not care to marry a prince,&#xA;she should remain a virgin and burn&#xA;herself on the pyre. How can a brahmana&#xA;marry her? We should oppose this&#xA;marriage and prevent it so as to protect&#xA;righteousness and save the practice of&#xA;swayamvara from the peril which&#xA;threatens it.&amp;rdquo; A free fight seemed&#xA;imminent.&#xA;Bhima plucked a tree by the roots, and&#xA;stripping it of foliage, stood armed with&#xA;this formidable bludgeon, by the side of&#xA;Arjuna ready for any event. Draupadi said&#xA;nothing but stood holding on to the skirts&#xA;of the deer-skin in which Arjuna was clad.&#xA;Krishna, Balarama and others sought to&#xA;appease those who had created the&#xA;confusion. Arjuna proceeded to the house&#xA;of the potter accompanied by Draupadi.&#xA;As Bhima and Arjuna were taking&#xA;Draupadi to their temporary abode,&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna followed them at a&#xA;distance, and, unseen by them, closely&#xA;observed everything that took place there.&#xA;He was amazed and delighted at what he&#xA;saw, and returning, he secretly told King&#xA;Drupada: &amp;ldquo;Father, I think they are the&#xA;Pandavas. Draupadi accompanied them,&#xA;holding to the skirts of the deer-skin of&#xA;that youth and she was not at all abashed.&#xA;I also followed and I saw all five and a&#xA;venerable and august lady who, I have no&#xA;doubt, is Kunti herself.&amp;ldquo;Invited by Drupada Kunti and the&#xA;Pandavas went to the palace. Dharmaputra&#xA;confided to the king that they were the&#xA;Pandavas. He also informed him of their&#xA;decision to marry Draupadi in common.&#xA;Drupada rejoiced at knowing that they&#xA;were the Pandavas, which set at rest all&#xA;anxiety regarding the enmity of Drona.&#xA;But he was surprised and disgusted when&#xA;he heard that they would jointly marry&#xA;Draupadi.&#xA;Drupada opposed this and said: &amp;ldquo;How&#xA;unrighteous! How did this idea get into&#xA;your head, this immoral idea that goes&#xA;against the traditional usage?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira answered: &amp;ldquo;O king, kindly&#xA;excuse us. In a time of great peril we&#xA;vowed that we would share all things in&#xA;common and we cannot break that pledge.&#xA;Our mother has commanded us so.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Finally Drupada yielded and the marriage&#xA;was celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN news of the incidents that took&#xA;place during the swayamvara at Panchala&#xA;reached Hastinapura, Vidura was happy.&#xA;He immediately went to Dhritarashtra and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;O King, our family has become&#xA;stronger because the daughter of Drupada&#xA;has become our daughter-in-law. Our stars&#xA;are good.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhritarashtra thought in his blind&#xA;fondness for his son that it was&#xA;Duryodhana, who had also gone to take&#xA;part in the swayamvara, that had won&#xA;Draupadi. Under this mistaken impression&#xA;he replied: &amp;ldquo;It is indeed, as you say, a&#xA;good time for us. Go at once and bring&#xA;Draupadi. Let us give Panchali a joyous&#xA;welcome.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vidura hastened to correct the mistake. He&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;The blessed Pandavas are alive and&#xA;it is Arjuna who has won the daughter of&#xA;Drupada. The five Pandavas have married&#xA;her jointly according to the rites enjoined&#xA;by the sastras. With their mother&#xA;Kuntidevi they are happy and well under&#xA;the care of Drupada.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At these words of Vidura, Dhritarashtra&#xA;felt&#xA;frustrated&#xA;but&#xA;concealed&#xA;his&#xA;disappointment. He said to Vidura with&#xA;apparent joy: &amp;ldquo;O Vidura, I am delighted at&#xA;your words. Are the dear Pandavas really&#xA;alive? We have been mourning them as&#xA;dead! The news you have now brought is&#xA;balm to my heart. So the daughter of&#xA;Drupada has become our daughter-in-law.&#xA;Well, well, very good.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;jealousy&#xA;and&#xA;hatred&#xA;redoubled when he found that the&#xA;Pandavas had somehow escaped from the&#xA;wax palace and after spending a year&#xA;incognito had now become even more&#xA;powerful on account of the alliance with&#xA;the mighty king of Panchala. Duryodhana&#xA;and his brother Duhsasana went to their&#xA;uncle Sakuni and said in sorrow: &amp;ldquo;Uncle,&#xA;we are undone. We have been let down by&#xA;relying on Purochana. Our enemies, the&#xA;Pandavas, are cleverer than ourselves, and&#xA;fortune also seems to favor them.&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin have&#xA;become their allies. What can we do?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Karna and Duryodhana went to the blind&#xA;Dhritarashtra. Duryodhana said: &amp;ldquo;You told&#xA;Vidura that better days were ahead of us.&#xA;Is it good time for us that our natural&#xA;enemies, the Pandavas, have so waxed n i&#xA;strength that they will certainly destroy&#xA;us? We could not carry out our plot&#xA;against them and the fact that they know&#xA;about it is an added danger. It has now&#xA;come to this, either we must destroy them&#xA;here and now or we shall ourselves perish.&#xA;Favor us with your counsel in this matter.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhritarashtra replied: &amp;ldquo;Dear son, what you&#xA;say is true. We should not, however, let&#xA;Vidura know our mind. That was why I&#xA;spoke to him in that manner. Let me now&#xA;hear your suggestions as to what we&#xA;should do.&amp;ldquo;Duryodhana said: &amp;ldquo;I feel so distracted that&#xA;no plan occurs to me. Perhaps, we may&#xA;take advantage of the fact that these&#xA;Pandavas are not born of one and the&#xA;same mother and create enmity between&#xA;the sons of Madri and those of Kunti. We&#xA;can also try to bribe Drupada into joining&#xA;our side. That he has given away his&#xA;daughter in marriage to the Pandavas will&#xA;not stand in the way of our making him an&#xA;ally. There is nothing that cannot be&#xA;accomplished by the power of wealth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Karna smiled and said: &amp;ldquo;This is but futile&#xA;talk.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana continued: &amp;ldquo;We should&#xA;somehow make sure that the Pandavas do&#xA;not come here and demand of us the&#xA;kingdom that is now in our possession.&#xA;We may commission a few brahmanas to&#xA;spread convenient rumours in Drupada&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;city and severally tell the Pandavas that&#xA;they would meet with great danger if they&#xA;were to go to Hastinapura. Then the&#xA;Pandavas would fear to come here and we&#xA;shall be safe, from them.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Karna replied: &amp;ldquo;This too is idle talk. You&#xA;cannot frighten them that way.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana continued: &amp;ldquo;Can we not&#xA;create discord among the Pandavas by&#xA;means of Draupadi? Her polyandrous&#xA;marriage is very convenient for us. We&#xA;shall arouse doubts and jealousies in their&#xA;minds through the efforts of experts in the&#xA;science of erotics. We shall certainly&#xA;succeed. We can get a beautiful woman to&#xA;beguile some of the sons of Kunti and&#xA;thus make Draupadi turn against them. If&#xA;Draupadi begins to suspect any of them,&#xA;we can invite him to Hastinapura and use&#xA;him so that our plan prospers.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Karna laughed this also to scorn. He said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;None of your proposals is any good. You&#xA;cannot conquer the Pandavas by&#xA;stratagem. When they were here and were&#xA;like immature birds with undeveloped&#xA;wings, we found we could not deceive&#xA;them, and you think we can deceive them&#xA;now, when they have acquired experience&#xA;and are moreover under the protection of&#xA;Drupada. They have seen through your&#xA;designs. Stratagems will not do hereafter.&#xA;You cannot sow dissensions among them.&#xA;You cannot bribe the wise and honorable&#xA;Drupada. He will not give up the&#xA;Pandavas on any account. Draupadi also&#xA;can never be turned against them.&#xA;Therefore, there is only one way left for&#xA;us, and that is to attack them before they&#xA;grow stronger and other friends join them.&#xA;We should make a surprise attack on the&#xA;Pandavas and Drupada before Krishna&#xA;joins them with his Yadava army. We&#xA;should take the heroic way out of our&#xA;difficulty, as befits kshatriyas. Trickery&#xA;will prove useless.&amp;rdquo; Thus spoke Karna.&#xA;Dhritarashtra could not make up his mind.&#xA;The king, therefore, sent for Bhishma and&#xA;Drona and consulted them.&#xA;Bhishma was very happy when he heard&#xA;that the Pandavas were alive and well as&#xA;guests of King Drupada of Panchala,&#xA;whose daughter they had married.&#xA;Consulted on the steps to be taken,&#xA;Bhishma, wise with the ripe knowledge of&#xA;right and wrong, replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The proper course will be to welcome&#xA;them back and give them half the&#xA;kingdom. The citizens of the state also&#xA;desire such a settlement. This is the only&#xA;way to maintain the dignity of our family.&#xA;There is much loose talk not creditable to&#xA;you about the fire incident at the wax&#xA;house. All blame, even all suspicion, will&#xA;be set at rest if you invite the Pandavas&#xA;and hand over half kingdom to them. This&#xA;is my advice.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Drona also gave the same counsel and&#xA;suggested sending a proper messenger to&#xA;bring about an amicable settlement and&#xA;establish peace.&#xA;Karna flew into a rage at this suggestion.&#xA;He was very much devoted toDuryodhana and could not at all bear the&#xA;idea of giving a portion of the kingdom to&#xA;the Pandavas. He told Dhritarashtra:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I am surprised that Drona, who has&#xA;received wealth and honors at your hands,&#xA;has made such a suggestion. A king&#xA;should examine critically the advice of his&#xA;ministers before accepting or rejecting it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At these words of Karna, Drona, his old&#xA;eyes full of anger, said: &amp;ldquo;O wicked man,&#xA;you are advising the king to go on the&#xA;wrong path. If Dhritarashtra does not do&#xA;what Bhishma and myself have advised,&#xA;the Kauravas will certainly meet with&#xA;destruction in the near future.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Dhritarashtra sought the advice of&#xA;Vidura who replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The counsel given by Bhishma, the head&#xA;of our race, and Drona, the master, is wise&#xA;and just and should not be disregarded.&#xA;The Pandavas are also your children like&#xA;Duryodhana and his brothers. You should&#xA;realise that those who advise you to injure&#xA;the Pandavas are really bent upon the&#xA;destruction of the race. Drupada and his&#xA;sons as well as Krishna and the Yadavas&#xA;are staunch allies of the Pandavas. It is&#xA;impossible to defeat them in battle.&#xA;Karna&amp;rsquo;s advice is foolish and wrong. It is&#xA;reported abroad that we tried to kill the&#xA;Pandavas in the wax house, and we should&#xA;first of all try to clear ourselves of the&#xA;blame. The citizens and the whole country&#xA;are delighted to know that the Pandavas&#xA;are alive and they desire to see them once&#xA;again. Do not listen to the words of&#xA;Duryodhana. Karna and Sakuni are but&#xA;raw youths, ignorant of statesmanship and&#xA;incompetent to advise. Follow Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;advice.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In the end Dhritarashtra determined to&#xA;establish peace by giving half the&#xA;kingdom to the sons of Pandu. He sent&#xA;Vidura to the kingdom of Panchala to&#xA;fetch the Pandavas and Draupadi.&#xA;Vidura went to the city of King Drupada&#xA;in a speedy vehicle taking along with him&#xA;many kinds of jewels and other valuable&#xA;presents.&#xA;Vidura rendered due honor to King&#xA;Drupada and requested him on behalf of&#xA;Dhritarashtra to send the Pandavas with&#xA;Panchali to Hastinapura.&#xA;Drupada mistrusted Dhritarashtra, but he&#xA;merely said: &amp;ldquo;The Pandavas may do as&#xA;they like.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vidura went to Kuntidevi and prostrated&#xA;himself before her. She said: &amp;ldquo;Son of&#xA;Vichitravirya, you saved my sons. They&#xA;are, therefore, your children. I trust you. I&#xA;shall do as you advise.&amp;rdquo; She was also&#xA;suspicious of Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s intentions.&#xA;Vidura thus assured her: &amp;ldquo;Your children&#xA;will never meet with destruction. They&#xA;will inherit the kingdom and acquire great&#xA;renown. Come, let us go.&amp;rdquo; At last Drupada&#xA;also gave his assent and Vidura returned&#xA;to Hastinapura with the Pandavas, Kunti,&#xA;and Draupadi.&#xA;In jubilant welcome of the beloved&#xA;princes who were returning home after&#xA;long years of exile and travail, the streets&#xA;of Hastinapura had been sprinkled with&#xA;water and decorated with flowers. As had&#xA;been already decided, half the kingdom&#xA;was made over to the Pandavas and&#xA;Yudhishthira was duly crowned king.&#xA;Dhritarashtra blessed the newly crowned&#xA;Yudhishthira and bade him farewell with&#xA;these words: &amp;ldquo;My brother Pandu made this&#xA;kingdom prosperous. May you prove a&#xA;worthy heir to his renown! King Pandu&#xA;delighted in abiding by my advice. Love&#xA;me in the same manner. My sons are&#xA;wicked and proud. I have made this&#xA;settlement so that there may be no strife or&#xA;hatred&#xA;between&#xA;you.&#xA;Go&#xA;to&#xA;Khandavaprastha and make it your&#xA;capital.&#xA;Our&#xA;ancestors&#xA;Pururavas,&#xA;Nahusha, and Yayati ruled the kingdom&#xA;from there. That was our ancient capital.Re-establish that and be famous.&amp;rdquo; In this&#xA;manner Dhritarashtra spoke affectionately&#xA;to Yudhishthira.&#xA;The Pandavas renovated that ruined city,&#xA;built palaces and forts, and renamed it&#xA;Indraprastha. It grew in wealth and beauty&#xA;and became the admiration of the world.&#xA;The Pandavas ruled there happily for&#xA;thirty-six years with their mother and&#xA;Draupadi, never straying from the path of&#xA;dharma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IN the stories narrated in the Puranas,&#xA;birds and beasts speak like men, and&#xA;sometimes they give sound advice and&#xA;even teach spiritual wisdom. But the&#xA;natural qualities of those creatures are&#xA;adroitly made to peep through this human&#xA;veil.&#xA;One of the characteristic beauties of the&#xA;Puranic literature is this happy fusion of&#xA;nature and imagination. In a delightful&#xA;passage in the Ramayana, Hanuman, who&#xA;is described as very wise and learned, is&#xA;made to frolic with apish joy, when he&#xA;imagined that the beautiful damsel he saw&#xA;at Ravana&amp;rsquo;s inner courtyard was Sita.&#xA;It is usual to entertain children with stories&#xA;in which birds and beasts are made to&#xA;speak. But the stories of the Puranas are&#xA;meant for elderly people, and in them&#xA;usually some background is given in&#xA;explanation of animals having the gift of&#xA;human speech.&#xA;The usual expedient employed is a&#xA;previous birth when those creatures were&#xA;human beings. For instance, a deer was a&#xA;rishi in a previous birth, or a fox a king.&#xA;The subsequent degradation being due to&#xA;a curse.&#xA;In such cases the deer will act as a deer&#xA;and yet speak as a rishi, and in the fox the&#xA;clever nature is shot through with the&#xA;characteristics of a wise and experienced&#xA;king. The stories are thereby made&#xA;interesting vehicles of the great truths they&#xA;sometimes convey.&#xA;Khandavaprastha, that forest full of&#xA;uneven places and thorns and prickles and&#xA;cumbered with the crumbling vestiges of a&#xA;long dead city, was indeed a frightful&#xA;place when it came into the possession of&#xA;the Pandavas.&#xA;Birds and beasts had made it their abode,&#xA;and it was infested with thieves and&#xA;wicked men. Krishna and Arjuna resolved&#xA;to set fire to the forest and construct a new&#xA;city in its place.&#xA;A saranga bird was living there with its&#xA;four fledgelings. The male bird was&#xA;pleasantly roaming about in the forest&#xA;with another female bird neglecting wife&#xA;and children. The mother bird looked after&#xA;its young ones.&#xA;As the forest was set on fire as&#xA;commanded by Krishna and Arjuna and&#xA;the fire spread in all directions, doing its&#xA;destructive work, the worried mother bird&#xA;began to lament:&#xA;&amp;lsquo;The fire is coming nearer and nearer&#xA;burning everything, and soon it will be&#xA;here and destroy us. All forest creatures&#xA;are in despair and the air is full of the&#xA;agonising crash of falling trees. Poor&#xA;wingless babies! You will become a prey&#xA;to the fire. What shall I do? Your father&#xA;has deserted us, and I am not strong&#xA;enough to fly away carrying you with&#xA;me.&amp;quot;&#xA;To the mother who was wailing thus, the&#xA;children said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Mother, do not torment yourself on our&#xA;account. Leave us to our fate. If we die&#xA;here, we shall attain a good birth in some&#xA;future life. If you give up your life for our&#xA;sake, our family will become extinct. Fly&#xA;to a place of safety, take another mate and&#xA;be happy. You will soon have other&#xA;children and be able to forget us. Mother,&#xA;reflect and do what is best for our race.&amp;ldquo;Despite this earnest entreaty, the mother&#xA;had no mind to leave her children. She&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;I shall remain here and perish in the&#xA;flames with you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This is the background of the story of the&#xA;birds. A rishi named Mandapala long&#xA;lived faithful to his vow of perfect&#xA;brahmacharya but when he sought entry to&#xA;the higher regions, the gatekeeper said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;There is no place here for a childless&#xA;man&amp;rdquo; and turned him back. He was then&#xA;born as a saranga bird and lived with a&#xA;female companion named Jarita. She laid&#xA;four eggs. Then he left Jarita and&#xA;wandered in the woods with another&#xA;female companion, Lapita.&#xA;The four eggs of Jarita hatched in time&#xA;and they were the four birds mentioned&#xA;above. As they were the children of a rishi&#xA;they could cheer and encourage their&#xA;mother in the way they did.&#xA;The mother bird told her children: &amp;ldquo;There&#xA;is a rat-hole by the side of this tree. I shall&#xA;put you there. You can get into the hole&#xA;and escape the fire. I shall close the mouth&#xA;of the hole with earth and the fire will not&#xA;touch you. When the fire dies down I shall&#xA;let you out.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The children would not agree. They said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The rat in the hole will devour us. It is&#xA;better to perish in the flames than to die&#xA;ignobly by being eaten up by rats.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The mother bird tried to relieve the fears&#xA;of the children and said: &amp;ldquo;I saw an eagle&#xA;devour the rat. There is now no danger for&#xA;you inside the hole.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But the children said: &amp;ldquo;There are sure to&#xA;be other rats in the hole. Our danger is not&#xA;ended by the killing of one rat by the&#xA;eagle. Kindly save your life by flying&#xA;before the fire reaches us and this tree&#xA;catches fire. We cannot get into the rat-&#xA;hole. Why should you sacrifice your life&#xA;for our sake? How have we merited it,&#xA;who have done nothing for you? We have&#xA;only brought you unhappiness since we&#xA;came into the world. Take another mate&#xA;and live happily.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The fire which destroyed the whole forest,&#xA;mercifully left the baby birds unscathed.&#xA;When the fire had subsided, the mother&#xA;bird came back and saw with wonder that&#xA;her children were safe and chirping&#xA;merrily. She embraced them and was&#xA;intensely happy.&#xA;While the fire was raging, the male bird,&#xA;anxious for the safety of his young ones,&#xA;had expressed his fears to his new love-&#xA;bird Lapita. She had petulantly upbraided&#xA;him. Hearing his repeated laments &amp;ldquo;Is it&#xA;so?&amp;rdquo; she said: &amp;ldquo;I know your mind, I know&#xA;that you desire to go back to Jarita, having&#xA;had enough of me. Why falsely bring in&#xA;the fire and the children? You have&#xA;yourself told me that the children of Jarita&#xA;would never perish in fire since the Fire&#xA;god has given you that boon. You may as&#xA;well tell the truth and go away, if you like,&#xA;to your beloved Jarita. I shall only be&#xA;another of the many trusting females&#xA;betrayed by unworthy males and cast out&#xA;wandering in the forest. You may go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The bird Mandapala said: &amp;ldquo;Your&#xA;assumption is untrue. I took birth as a bird&#xA;for obtaining children and I am naturally&#xA;anxious about them.&#xA;I shall just go and see them and then come&#xA;back to you &amp;quot; Having thus consoled his&#xA;new mate, be went to the tree where Jarita&#xA;was seated.&#xA;Jarita paid no attention to her consort but&#xA;remained absorbed in joy at finding her&#xA;children alive.&#xA;Then she turned to her husband and asked&#xA;in an indifferent tone why he had come.&#xA;He replied with affection:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Are my children happy? Who is the&#xA;eldest among them?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Jarita cut in icily: &amp;ldquo;Do you greatly&#xA;care? Go back to her for whom you&#xA;abandoned me. Be happy with her.&amp;ldquo;Mandapala philosophised: &amp;ldquo;A woman will&#xA;not care for her husband after she has&#xA;become a mother. Such is the way of the&#xA;world. Even the blameless Vasishtha was&#xA;thus ignored by Arundhati.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE Pandavas ruled Indraprastha in all&#xA;glory.&#xA;Those&#xA;who&#xA;surrounded&#xA;Yudhishthira urged him to perform the&#xA;Rajasuya sacrifice and assume the title of&#xA;Emperor. It is evident that imperialism&#xA;had an irresistible glamour even in those&#xA;days.&#xA;Yudhishthira sought Sri Krishna&amp;rsquo;s advice&#xA;in this matter. When Krishna learnt that&#xA;Dharmaputra desired to see him, he set&#xA;out in a chariot harnessed with swift&#xA;horses and reached Indraprastha.&#xA;Yudhishthira said: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;My people urge me to&#xA;perform Rajasuya, but as you know, only&#xA;he who can secure the respect and&#xA;allegiance of all kings, can perform that&#xA;sacrifice and win the status of emperor.&#xA;Advise me, you are not among those&#xA;whose affection makes them blind and&#xA;partial. Nor are you one of those who&#xA;advise to please and whose counsel is&#xA;pleasant rather than true or wholesome.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Krishna replied: &amp;ldquo;Quite so and that is why&#xA;you cannot be emperor while the mighty&#xA;Jarasandha of Magadha is alive and&#xA;unconquered. He has conquered many&#xA;kings and holds them in subjection. All&#xA;the kshatriyas, including the redoubtable&#xA;Sisupala himself, are afraid of his prowess&#xA;and are submissive to him. Have you not&#xA;heard of the wicked Kamsa, the son of&#xA;Ugrasena? After he had become the son-&#xA;in-law and ally of Jarasandha my people&#xA;and I attacked Jarasandha. After three&#xA;years of continuous fighting we had to&#xA;acknowledge defeat and we left Mathura&#xA;and moved to Dwaraka in the west, and&#xA;built a new city where we are living in&#xA;peace and plenty. Even if Duryodhana,&#xA;Karna and others do not object to your&#xA;assuming the title of emperor, Jarasandha&#xA;will certainly oppose it. And the only way&#xA;to overcome his opposition is to defeat&#xA;and kill him. You can then not only&#xA;perform the Rajasuya but also rescue and&#xA;win the adherence of the kings who&#xA;languish in his prisons.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At these words of Krishna, Yudhishthira&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;I agree. I am but one of the many&#xA;kings who rule their kingdoms with&#xA;fairness and justice and lead happy&#xA;unambitious lives. It is mere vanity and&#xA;vainglory to desire to become an emperor.&#xA;Why should not a king rest satisfied with&#xA;his own kingdom? So, I shall give up this&#xA;desire to be an emperor. And really, the&#xA;title has no temptations for me. It is my&#xA;brothers who wish it. When you yourself&#xA;are afraid of Jarasandha what can we hope&#xA;to do?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhima did not at all like this spirit of&#xA;cowardly contentment.&#xA;Bhima said: &amp;ldquo;Ambition is the noblest&#xA;virtue of a king. What is the good of being&#xA;strong if one does not know his own&#xA;strength? I cannot reconcile myself to live&#xA;a life of idle ease and contentment. He&#xA;who casts off indolence and properly&#xA;employs political means, can conquer&#xA;even those stronger than himself. Strength&#xA;reinforced by stratagem will surely do&#xA;much.&#xA;What,&#xA;indeed,&#xA;cannot&#xA;be&#xA;accomplished by a combination of my&#xA;physical strength, Krishna&amp;rsquo;s wisdom and&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s dexterity? We can conquer&#xA;Jarasandha&amp;rsquo;s might, if we three join and&#xA;set about it without doubts or fears.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Krishna interposed: &amp;ldquo;Jarasandha should&#xA;certainly be slain and fully deserves it. He&#xA;has unjustly cast eighty-six princes in&#xA;prison. He has planned to immolate a&#xA;hundred kings and is waiting to lay hold&#xA;of fourteen more. If Bhima and Arjuna&#xA;agree, I shall accompany them and&#xA;together we will slay that king bystratagem and set free the imprisoned&#xA;princes. I like this suggestion.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira was not pleased with this&#xA;advice. He said: &amp;ldquo;This may really mean&#xA;sacrificing Bhima and Arjuna who are to&#xA;me as my two eyes, merely to gratify a&#xA;vain desire to be an emperor. I do not like&#xA;to send them on this dangerous errand. It&#xA;seems to me far better to give up the idea&#xA;altogether.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna said: &amp;ldquo;What is the use to us of an&#xA;existence without heroic deeds, born as&#xA;we are of an illustrious line? A Kshatriya&#xA;though endowed with all other good&#xA;qualities, will not become famous if he&#xA;does not exert himself. Enthusiasm is the&#xA;mother of success. We can seize fortune if&#xA;we do our duties energetically. Even a&#xA;powerful man may fail if, through&#xA;lassitude, he does not employ the means&#xA;he has. Failure is due, in the vast majority&#xA;of cases, to ignorance of one&amp;rsquo;s own&#xA;strength. We know we are strong, and we&#xA;are not afraid of using our strength to the&#xA;utmost. Why should Yudhishthira suppose&#xA;that we are incapable of this? When we&#xA;have become old, it will be time to assume&#xA;the ochre robe, resort to the forest and&#xA;pass the rest of our days in penance and&#xA;austerities. Now, we should lead strenuous&#xA;lives and do heroic deeds worthy of the&#xA;traditions of our race.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Krishna was delighted to hear these words&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;What else can Arjuna, born of&#xA;Kunti in the Bharata race, advise? Death&#xA;comes to all, the hero as well as the&#xA;sluggard. But the noblest duty of a&#xA;kshatriya is to be true to his race and faith,&#xA;and overcoming his foes in righteous&#xA;battle, to win glory.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Finally Yudhishthira assented to the&#xA;unanimous opinion that their duty lay in&#xA;slaying Jarasandha.&#xA;This conversation has a curiously modern&#xA;ring about it and shows that powerful men&#xA;in ancient days used very much the same&#xA;specious reasoning as now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BRIHADRATHA, the commander of&#xA;three regiments, reigned in the kingdom of&#xA;Magadha and attained celebrity as a great&#xA;hero. He married the twin daughters of the&#xA;raja of Kasi and vowed to them that he&#xA;would not show any partiality to either.&#xA;Brihadratha was not blessed with a child&#xA;for a long time. When he became old, he&#xA;handed over his kingdom to his ministers,&#xA;went to the forest with his two wives and&#xA;engaged himself in austerities.&#xA;He went to Sage Kausika of the Gautama&#xA;family, with a sorrowful longing for&#xA;children in his heart. And when the sage&#xA;was moved with pity and asked him what&#xA;he wanted, he answered:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I am childless and have come to the&#xA;forest giving up my kingdom. Give me&#xA;children.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The sage was filled with compassion and,&#xA;even as he was thinking how to help the&#xA;king, a mango fruit fell into his lap. He&#xA;took it and gave it to the king with this&#xA;blessing: &amp;ldquo;Take it. Your wish will be&#xA;fulfilled.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The king cut the fruit into two halves and&#xA;gave one to each wife. He did so to keep&#xA;his vow not to show partiality to either.&#xA;Some time after they had partaken of the&#xA;fruit, the wives became pregnant.&#xA;The delivery took place in due course. But&#xA;instead of bringing the expected joy, it&#xA;plunged them into greater grief than&#xA;before. For they each gave birth to but a&#xA;half of a child. Each half was a monstrous&#xA;birth which seemed a revolting lump.&#xA;They were indeed two equal and&#xA;complementary portions of one baby,&#xA;consisting of one eye, one leg, half a face,&#xA;one ear and so on. Seized with grief, they&#xA;commanded their attendants to tie thegruesome pieces in a cloth and cast them&#xA;away.&#xA;The attendants did as they were instructed&#xA;and threw the cloth bundle on a heap of&#xA;refuse in the street. A cannibal Rakshasi&#xA;chanced upon that place. She was elated at&#xA;seeing the two pieces of flesh and, as she&#xA;gathered them up both at once, accidently&#xA;the halves came together the right way.&#xA;And they at once adhered together and&#xA;changed into a whole living child, perfect&#xA;in every detail.&#xA;The surprised Rakshasi did not wish to&#xA;kill the child. She took on the guise of a&#xA;beautiful woman and, going to the king,&#xA;presented the child to him saying: &amp;ldquo;This is&#xA;your child.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The king was immensely delighted and&#xA;handed it over to his two wives. This child&#xA;became known as Jarasandha. He grew up&#xA;in to a man of immense physical strength.&#xA;But his body had one weakness namely,&#xA;that being made up by the fusion of two&#xA;separate parts, it could be split again into&#xA;two, if sufficient force were used.&#xA;This interesting story embodies the&#xA;important truth that two sundered parts&#xA;joined together will still remain weak,&#xA;with a tendency to split. When the&#xA;conquest and slaying of Jarasandha had&#xA;been resolved upon, Sri Krishna said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Hamsa, Hidimbaka, Kamsa, and other&#xA;allies of Jarasandha are no more. Now that&#xA;he is isolated, this is the right time to kill&#xA;him. It is useless to fight with armies. He&#xA;must be provoked to a single combat and&#xA;slain.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;According to the code of honor of those&#xA;days, a kshatriya had to accept the&#xA;challenge to a duel whether with or&#xA;without weapons.&#xA;The latter sort was a fight to the death&#xA;with weighted gauntlets or a wrestling to&#xA;the death in catch-as-catch-can style. This&#xA;was the kshatriya tradition to which&#xA;Krishna and the Pandavas had recourse&#xA;for slaying Jarasandha.&#xA;They disguised themselves as men who&#xA;had taken religious vows, clad in robes of&#xA;bark-fibre and carrying the holy darbha&#xA;grass in their hands. Thus they entered the&#xA;kingdom of Magadha and arrived at the&#xA;capital of Jarasandha.&#xA;Jarasandha was disturbed by portents of ill&#xA;omen. To ward off the threatened danger,&#xA;he had propitiatory rites performed by the&#xA;priests and himself took to fasts and&#xA;penance.&#xA;Krishna, Bhima, and Arjuna entered the&#xA;palace unarmed. Jarasandha received them&#xA;with respect as their noble bearing seemed&#xA;to indicate an illustrious origin. Bhima&#xA;and Arjuna made no reply to his words of&#xA;welcome because they wished to avoid&#xA;having to tell lies.&#xA;Krishna spoke on their behalf: &amp;ldquo;These two&#xA;are observing a vow of silence for the&#xA;present as at part of their austerities. They&#xA;can&#xA;speak&#xA;only&#xA;after&#xA;midnight.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Jarasandha entertained them in the hall of&#xA;sacrifice and returned to the palace.&#xA;It was the practice of Jarasandha to meet&#xA;noble guests who had taken vows and talk&#xA;to them at their leisure and convenience,&#xA;and so he called at midnight to see them.&#xA;Their&#xA;conduct&#xA;made&#xA;Jarasandha&#xA;suspicious, and he also observed that they&#xA;had on their hands the scars made by the&#xA;bowstring and had besides the proud&#xA;bearing of kshatriyas.&#xA;When Jarasandha demanded the truth of&#xA;them they said frankly: &amp;ldquo;We are your foes&#xA;and seek instant combat. You can choose&#xA;one of us at will to fight with you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After acquainting himself as to who they&#xA;were, Jarasandha said: &amp;ldquo;Krishna, you are a&#xA;cowherd and Arjuna is a mere boy. Bhima&#xA;is famous for his physical strength. So, I&#xA;wish to fight with him.&amp;rdquo; Since Bhima was&#xA;unarmed, Jarasandha chivalrously agreed&#xA;to fight him without weapons.Bhima and Jarasandha were so equally&#xA;matched in strength that they fought with&#xA;each other continuously for thirteen days&#xA;without taking rest or refreshments, while&#xA;Krishna and Arjuna looked on in&#xA;alternating hope and anxiety.&#xA;On the fourteenth day, Jarasandha showed&#xA;signs of exhaustion, and Krishna&#xA;prompted Bhima that the time had come&#xA;to make an end of him.&#xA;At once Bhima lifted him and whirling&#xA;him round and round a hundred times,&#xA;dashed him to the earth and seizing his&#xA;legs tore his body asunder into two halves.&#xA;And Bhima roared in exultation. The two&#xA;halves at once joined and Jarasandha, thus&#xA;made whole, leapt up into vigorous life&#xA;and again attacked Bhima.&#xA;Bhima aghast at the sight, was at a loss&#xA;what to do, when he saw Krishna pick up&#xA;a straw, tear it into two, and cast the bits&#xA;in opposite directions.&#xA;Bhima took the hint, and when once again&#xA;he tore Jarasandha asunder he threw the&#xA;two portions in opposite directions, so that&#xA;they could not come together and join.&#xA;Thus did Jarasandha meet his end.&#xA;The captive princes were released and&#xA;Jarasandha&amp;rsquo;s son was crowned King of&#xA;Magadha. And Krishna, Bhima and&#xA;Arjuna returned to Indraprastha.&#xA;With Jarasandha gone, the way was now&#xA;clear for the Rajasuya which the Pandavas&#xA;performed with great pomp and splendor.&#xA;Yudhishthira assumed the title of&#xA;emperor.&#xA;The celebrations were marred by only one&#xA;incident. Towards the close of the festive&#xA;celebrations, at the time of paying the first&#xA;honor, Sisupala behaved disrespectfully in&#xA;the assembly of princes and provoked a&#xA;fight with Krishna in which he was slain.&#xA;This story is told in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE practice of staging a walkout from&#xA;an assembly in protest against something&#xA;is nothing new. We learn from the&#xA;Mahabharata that walkout was resorted to&#xA;even in ancient times.&#xA;The India of those days consisted of a&#xA;number of independent states. Though&#xA;there was one dharma and one culture&#xA;throughout the land, the autonomy of each&#xA;state was scrupulosly respected.&#xA;Occasionally, some strong and ambitious&#xA;monarch would seek the assent of his&#xA;fellow kings to his overlordship, which&#xA;would sometimes be given without&#xA;question.&#xA;After receiving this assent he would&#xA;perform a grand Rajasuya sacrifice, which&#xA;all the acquiescing kings would attend in&#xA;token of acknowledgement of his&#xA;supremacy.&#xA;In accordance with this custom, the&#xA;Pandavas invited the other kings after the&#xA;slaying of Jarasandha and performed the&#xA;Rajasuya.&#xA;The time came for doing the honors of the&#xA;occasion. The custom was to render first&#xA;honor to the guest who was considered&#xA;most worthy of taking precedence over all&#xA;others.&#xA;The question arose as to who should be&#xA;honored first. The grandsire was&#xA;emphatically of the opinion that Sri&#xA;Krishna, the king of Dwaraka, should be&#xA;honored&#xA;first,&#xA;which&#xA;was&#xA;also&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s own opinion.&#xA;Yudhishthira followed the advice and&#xA;under his instructions Sahadeva offered to&#xA;Sri Krishna the honors enjoined by&#xA;tradition. Sisupala, the king of Chedi, who&#xA;hated Krishna as wickedness alone can&#xA;hate goodness, could not tolerate it.&#xA;He laughed aloud in derision and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;How ridiculous and unjust, but I am not&#xA;surprised. The man who sought advice&#xA;was born in illegitimacy. (This was an&#xA;insulting allusion to the sons of Kunti)&#xA;The man who gave advice was born of&#xA;one who ever declines from high to low.(This is in reference to the fact that&#xA;Bhishma was born of Ganga, the river&#xA;naturally flowing from higher to lower&#xA;levels.) And he who did the honors was&#xA;also born illegitimately. And what shall I&#xA;say of the man honored! He is a fool by&#xA;birth and a cowherd by breeding. Dumb&#xA;indeed must be the members of this&#xA;assembly if they have not a word to say to&#xA;this! This is no place for worthy men.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Some of the assembled princes applauded&#xA;Sisupala. Encouraged by their applause he&#xA;addressed Yudhishthira:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;When there are so many kings gathered&#xA;here, it is a shame that you paid the first&#xA;honor to Krishna. Not to render respect&#xA;where it is rightly due and to render it&#xA;where it is not merited are both equally&#xA;grave offences. It is a pity that, for all&#xA;your imperial pretensions you are ignorant&#xA;of this.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Getting more and more angry as he spoke,&#xA;he continued: &amp;ldquo;Ignoring the many kings&#xA;and heroes who are here at your own&#xA;invitation and in malicious despise of&#xA;them, you have paid royal honors to a&#xA;cowherd boor, a mere nobody. Vasudeva,&#xA;the father of Krishna, was but a servant of&#xA;Ugrasena. He is not even of royal blood.&#xA;Is this the place and the occasion to show&#xA;your vulgar partiality for Krishna, the son&#xA;of Devaki? Is this worthy of the children&#xA;of Pandu? O sons of Pandu, you are raw,&#xA;untaught youths, altogether ignorant of the&#xA;way to conduct a royal assembly. This&#xA;dotard Bhishma guided you foolishly and&#xA;thus made fools of you. Krishna, why,&#xA;Krishna is no ruler at all! O Yudhishthira,&#xA;why did you dare to do this wretch first&#xA;honor in this illustrious assemblage of&#xA;kings? He has not even the merit of age&#xA;and if you admire grey hair, is not his&#xA;father alive? You could not have honored&#xA;him as your preceptor surely, for your&#xA;preceptor is Drona who is here in this&#xA;assembly. Is it as an expert in performing&#xA;sacrifices that you have honored him? It&#xA;cannot be, for Vyasa, the great master, is&#xA;present. It would have been better even if&#xA;you had paid the first honor to Bhishma,&#xA;for dotard as he be, he has still the merit&#xA;of being the oldest man of your house.&#xA;Your family teacher, Kripacharya, is also&#xA;present in this assembly. How could you&#xA;then pay the first honor to this cowherd?&#xA;Ashwatthama, the hero who is expert in&#xA;all sastras, is here. How did you choose&#xA;Krishna, forgetting him? Among the&#xA;princes&#xA;assembled&#xA;here,&#xA;there&#xA;is&#xA;Duryodhana. And there is also Karna, the&#xA;disciple of Parasurama. Leaving him&#xA;aside, out of childish partiality, you chose&#xA;Krishna for the first honor Krishna who is&#xA;neither royal, nor heroic, nor learned, nor&#xA;holy, nor even hoary, who is nothing but a&#xA;low cowherd! Thus you have dishonored&#xA;us all, whom you have invited here. O&#xA;kings, it is not out of fear that we assented&#xA;to Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s assuming the title of&#xA;emperor. We personally do not much care&#xA;whether he is friend or foe. But, having&#xA;heard much prate of his righteousness, we&#xA;wanted to see him uphold the flag of&#xA;dharma. He has now wantonly dishonored&#xA;us, after all that talk of virtue and dharma.&#xA;What virtue or dharma was there in his&#xA;giving priority of honor to this villain&#xA;Krishna who killed Jarasandha in an&#xA;unjust manner? You should henceforth&#xA;call Yudhishthira an unrighteous person.&#xA;O Krishna, what impudence on your part&#xA;to accept the undeserved honor which&#xA;these misguided Pandavas did you! Did&#xA;you forget yourself? Or did you forget&#xA;decent tradition? Or was it just a case of a&#xA;dog snatching at a remnant of food which&#xA;nobody cared to claim or guard? Do you&#xA;not really see that this farce is a ghastly&#xA;mockery and disgrace to yourself? It is&#xA;like the mockery of showing beautiful&#xA;things to a blind man or offering a maiden&#xA;in marriage to a eunuch. Likewise, thesekingly honors are really an affront to you.&#xA;It is now evident that the would-be&#xA;emperor&#xA;Yudhishthira,&#xA;the&#xA;senile&#xA;Bhishma, and this fellow Krishna are all&#xA;made of the same stuff.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After Sisupala had spoken these harsh&#xA;words, he rose from his seat and walked&#xA;out calling upon the other kings to join&#xA;him in resenting the insult. Many of them&#xA;followed him.&#xA;Yudhishthira ran after them and tried to&#xA;appease them with sweet words of peace&#xA;but in vain, for they were too angry to be&#xA;appeased.&#xA;Sisupala&amp;rsquo;s aggressive vanity waxed to&#xA;fighting pitch, and there ensued a terrible&#xA;fight between Krishna and Sisupala, in&#xA;which the latter was slain by his discus.&#xA;The Rajasuya was duly celebrated and&#xA;Yudhishthira recognised emperor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AT the close of the Rajasuya, the princes,&#xA;priests and elders, who had gathered for&#xA;the purpose, took leave and returned to&#xA;their places. Vyasa also came to say&#xA;farewell. Dharmaputra rose and received&#xA;him with due respect and sat by his side.&#xA;The sage said: &amp;ldquo;O son of Kunti, you have&#xA;got the title of emperor which you&#xA;eminently deserve. May the illustrious&#xA;Kuru race gain even greater glory through&#xA;you. Give me leave to return to my&#xA;hermitage.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira touched the feet of his&#xA;progenitor and guru and said: &amp;ldquo;O master,&#xA;you alone can remove my apprehensions.&#xA;Wise men have predicted from portents&#xA;the happenings of catastrophic events. Has&#xA;this prediction been fulfilled by the death&#xA;of Sisupala or is more to ensue?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhagavan Vyasa replied: &amp;ldquo;Dear child,&#xA;much sorrow and suffering is in store for&#xA;thirteen years to come. The portents&#xA;indicate the destruction of the Kshatriya&#xA;race and are not exhausted with the death&#xA;of Sisupala. It is far from it. Hundreds of&#xA;kings will perish, and the old order of&#xA;things will pass away. This catastrophe&#xA;will spring out of the enmity between you&#xA;and your brothers on the one side and&#xA;your cousins, the Dhritarashtras, on the&#xA;other. It will culminate in a war resulting&#xA;in practical annihilation of the Kshatriya&#xA;race. No one can go against destiny. Be&#xA;firm and steadfast in righteousness. Be&#xA;vigilant and rule the kingdom, farewell.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And Vyasa blessed Yudhishthira. Vyasa&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;words filled Yudhishthira with grief and&#xA;with a great repugnance for worldly&#xA;ambition and life itself.&#xA;He informed his brothers of the prediction&#xA;of unavoidable racial disaster. Life&#xA;seemed to him a bitter and weary business&#xA;and his destiny particularly cruel and&#xA;unbearable.&#xA;Arjuna said: &amp;ldquo;You are a king and it is not&#xA;right for you to be agitated. Let us meet&#xA;destiny with an undaunted front and do&#xA;our duty.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Brothers, may God&#xA;protect us and give us wisdom. For my&#xA;part, I take this vow never to speak&#xA;harshly to my brothers or to my kinsmen&#xA;for the next thirteen years. I shall avoid all&#xA;pretext for conflict. I shall never give way&#xA;to anger, which is the root cause of&#xA;enmity. It shall be my duty to give no&#xA;occasion for anger or pretext for hostility.&#xA;Thus shall we profit by Bhagavan Vyasa&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;warning.&amp;rdquo; His brothers expressed cordial&#xA;assent.&#xA;The first event of the series which&#xA;culminated in the devastating slaughter on&#xA;the blood-sodden field of Kurukshetra and&#xA;the event which was the evil root of all,&#xA;was the gambling match into which&#xA;Yudhishthira was inveigled by Sakuni,&#xA;who was Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s evil genius.&#xA;Why did the wise and good Yudhishthira&#xA;suffer himself to be persuaded to this step&#xA;which he must have known to hold evil&#xA;possibilities?The main cause was his fixed resolve to&#xA;be on amicable terms with his cousins by&#xA;not opposing their wishes. And a friendly&#xA;invitation to dice could not be summarily&#xA;turned down, since the etiquette of those&#xA;days made it a point of honor to accept a&#xA;game of equal hazard.&#xA;Out of his very anxiety to foster goodwill,&#xA;he laid open the field for the poisonous&#xA;seed of hatred and death. Here is an&#xA;illustration of the futility of human plans,&#xA;however well meant or wise, without&#xA;divine aid. Our best wisdom is vain&#xA;against fate, and if destiny is kind, our&#xA;very follies turn to our advantage.&#xA;While Dharmaputra was care-worn with&#xA;solicitude to avoid a quarrel at all costs,&#xA;Duryodhana was burning with jealousy at&#xA;the thought of the prosperity of the&#xA;Pandavas that he had witnessed in their&#xA;capital during the Rajasuya sacrifice.&#xA;Duryodhana saw unprecedented wealth,&#xA;attractive and sight eluding crystal doors&#xA;and many pieces of exquisite artistry in&#xA;the court-hall of Yudhishthira, all&#xA;suggestive of great prosperity.&#xA;He also saw how glad the kings of many&#xA;countries were to become the allies of the&#xA;Pandavas. This gave him unbearable grief.&#xA;He was so absorbed in sorrow at the&#xA;prosperity of the Pandavas that he did not&#xA;at first hear Sakuni who was by his side,&#xA;speaking to him.&#xA;Sakuni asked: &amp;ldquo;Why are you sighing?&#xA;Why are you tormented with sorrow?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana&#xA;replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yudhishthira,&#xA;surrounded by his brothers, is like Indra,&#xA;the king of gods. Before the very eyes of&#xA;the assembled kings Sisupala was slain&#xA;and not one of them had the courage to&#xA;come forward to avenge him. Like the&#xA;vaisyas who live by trade, they bartered&#xA;their honor and jewels and riches for&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s goodwill. How can I avoid&#xA;giving way to grief after seeing all this?&#xA;What is the good of living?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sakuni said: &amp;ldquo;O Duryodhana, the&#xA;Pandavas are your brothers. It is not right&#xA;on your part to be jealous of their&#xA;prosperity. They are but enjoying their&#xA;legitimate inheritance. By their good&#xA;fortune they have prospered and&#xA;flourished without doing any injury to&#xA;others. Why should you be jealous? How&#xA;can their strength and happiness diminish&#xA;your greatness? Your brothers and&#xA;relations stand by you and obey you.&#xA;Drona, Ashwatthama and Karna are on&#xA;your side. Why do you grieve when&#xA;Bhishma, Kripa, Jayadratha, Somadatta&#xA;and myself are your supporters? You can&#xA;conquer even the whole world. Do not&#xA;give way to grief.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At these words, Duryodhana said: &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;Sakuni, it is true that I have so many to&#xA;support me. Why should we not wage war&#xA;and drive the Pandavas out of&#xA;Indraprastha?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Sakuni said: &amp;ldquo;No. That will not be&#xA;easy, but I know a way to drive&#xA;Yudhishthira out of Indraprastha without a&#xA;fight or the shedding of blood.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The eyes of Duryodhana lighted up, but it&#xA;seemed too good to be true. He asked&#xA;incredulously: &amp;ldquo;Uncle, is it possible to&#xA;overcome&#xA;the&#xA;Pandavas&#xA;without&#xA;sacrificing any life? What is your plan?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sakuni replied: &amp;ldquo;Yudhishthira is fond of&#xA;the game of dice and being unskillful is&#xA;altogether ignorant of its tricks and the&#xA;opportunity it offers to cleverer people. If&#xA;we invite him to a game, he would accept,&#xA;following the tradition of the kshatriyas. I&#xA;know the tricks of the game and I shall&#xA;play on your behalf. Yudhishthira will be&#xA;helpless as a child against me. I shall win&#xA;his kingdom and wealth for you without&#xA;shedding a drop of blood.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DURYODHANA and Sakuni went to&#xA;Dhritarashtra.&#xA;Sakuni&#xA;opened&#xA;the&#xA;conversation.&#xA;He&#xA;said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O&#xA;king,Duryodhana is wan with grief and anxiety.&#xA;You are paying no attention to his&#xA;unbearable sorrow. Why this unconcern?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhritarashtra who doted on his son&#xA;embraced Duryodhana and said: &amp;ldquo;I do not&#xA;see why you should be disconsolate. What&#xA;is here that you already do not enjoy? The&#xA;whole world is at your feet. When you are&#xA;surrounded by all kinds of pleasures like&#xA;the very gods, why should you pine in&#xA;sorrow? You have learnt the Vedas,&#xA;archery, and other sciences from the best&#xA;of masters. As my first born, you have&#xA;inherited the throne. What is left you to&#xA;wish for? Tell me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana&#xA;replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Father,&#xA;like&#xA;anybody else, rich or poor, I eat and cover&#xA;my nakedness, but I find life unbearable.&#xA;What is the use of leading such a life?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And then he revealed in detail the envy&#xA;and hatred that were eating into his vitals&#xA;and depriving life of its savour. He&#xA;referred to the prosperity he had seen in&#xA;the capital of the Pandavas that to him&#xA;was bitterer than loss of his all would&#xA;have been.&#xA;He burst out: &amp;ldquo;Contentment with one&amp;rsquo;s lot&#xA;is not characteristic of a kshatriya. Fear&#xA;and pity lower the dignity of kings. My&#xA;wealth and pleasures do not give me any&#xA;satisfaction since I have witnessed the&#xA;greater prosperity of Yudhishthira. O&#xA;king, the Pandavas have grown, while we&#xA;have shrunk.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhritarashtra said: &amp;ldquo;Beloved child, you&#xA;are the eldest son of my royal spouse and&#xA;me and heir to the glory and greatness of&#xA;our renowned race. Do not cherish any&#xA;hatred towards the Pandavas. Sorrow and&#xA;death will be the sole result of hatred of&#xA;kith and kin, especially when they are&#xA;blameless. Tell me, why do you hate the&#xA;guileless Yudhishthira? Is not his&#xA;prosperity ours too? Our friends are his&#xA;friends. He has not the least jealousy or&#xA;hatred towards us. You are equal to him in&#xA;heroism and ancestry. Why should you be&#xA;jealous of your brother? No. You should&#xA;not be jealous.&amp;rdquo; Thus said the old king&#xA;who, though overfond of his son, did not&#xA;occasionally hesitate to say what he felt to&#xA;be just.&#xA;Duryodhana did not at all like the advice&#xA;of his father, and his reply was not very&#xA;respectful.&#xA;He replied: &amp;ldquo;The man without common&#xA;sense, but immersed in learning, is like a&#xA;wooden ladle immersed in savoury food&#xA;which it neither tastes nor benefits from.&#xA;You have much learning of statecraft but&#xA;have no state wisdom at all, as your&#xA;advice to me clearly shows. The way of&#xA;the world is one thing and the&#xA;administration of a state is quite another.&#xA;Thus has Brihaspati said: &amp;lsquo;Forbearance&#xA;and contentment, though the duties of&#xA;ordinary men, are not virtues in kings.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;The kshatriya&amp;rsquo;s duty is a constant seeking&#xA;of victory.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana spoke thus quoting maxims&#xA;of politics and citing examples and&#xA;making the worse appear the better&#xA;reason.&#xA;Then Sakuni intervened and set forth in&#xA;detail his infallible plan of inviting&#xA;Yudhishthira to play the game of dice,&#xA;defeating him utterly and divesting him of&#xA;his all without recourse to arms.&#xA;The wicked Sakuni wound up with&#xA;saying: &amp;ldquo;It is enough if you merely send&#xA;for the son of Kunti to play the game of&#xA;dice. Leave the rest to me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana added: &amp;ldquo;Sakuni will win for&#xA;me the riches of the Pandavas without a&#xA;fight, if you would only agree to invite&#xA;Yudhishthira.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhritarashtra said: &amp;ldquo;Your suggestion does&#xA;not seem proper. Let us ask Vidura about&#xA;it. He will advise us rightly.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Duryodhana would not hear of&#xA;consulting Vidura. He said to his father:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Vidura will only give us the platitudes ofordinary morality, which will not help us&#xA;to our object. The policy of kings must be&#xA;very different from the goody maxims of&#xA;textbooks, and is sterner stuff of which the&#xA;test is success. Moreover, Vidura does not&#xA;like me and is partial to the Pandavas.&#xA;You know this as well as I do.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhritarashtra said: &amp;ldquo;The Pandavas are&#xA;strong. I do not think it wise to antagonize&#xA;them. The game of dice will only lead to&#xA;enmity. The passions resulting from the&#xA;game will know no bounds. We should&#xA;not do it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Duryodhana was importunate: &amp;ldquo;Wise&#xA;statesmanship lies in casting off all fear&#xA;and protecting oneself by one&amp;rsquo;s own&#xA;efforts. Should we not force the issue&#xA;while yet we are more powerful than they&#xA;are? That will be real foresight. A lost&#xA;opportunity may never come again, and it&#xA;is not as though we invented the game of&#xA;dice to injure the Pandavas. It is an&#xA;ancient pastime which kshatriyas have&#xA;always indulged in, and if it will now&#xA;serve us to win our cause without&#xA;bloodshed, where is the harm?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhritarashtra replied: &amp;ldquo;Dear son, I have&#xA;grown old. Do as you like. But the line&#xA;that you are taking does not appeal to me.&#xA;I am sure you will repent later. This is the&#xA;work of destiny.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In the end, out-argued and through sheer&#xA;fatigue and hopelessness of dissuading his&#xA;son, Dhritarashtra assented, and ordered&#xA;the servants to prepare a hall of games.&#xA;Yet he could not forbear consulting&#xA;Vidura in secret about the matter.&#xA;Vidura said: &amp;ldquo;O king, this will&#xA;undoubtedly bring about the ruin of our&#xA;race by raising up unquenchable hate.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhritarashtra, who could not oppose the&#xA;demand of his son, said: &amp;ldquo;If fortune favors&#xA;us I have no fear regarding this game. If&#xA;on the contrary, fortune goes against us,&#xA;how could we help it? For, destiny is all-&#xA;powerful. Go and invite Yudhishthira on&#xA;my behalf to come and play dice.&amp;rdquo; Thus&#xA;commanded, Vidura went to Yudhishthira&#xA;with an invitation.&#xA;The weak-witted Dhritarashtra, over-&#xA;persuaded, yielded to the desire of his son&#xA;through his attachment to him in spite of&#xA;the fact that he knew this was the way that&#xA;destiny was working itself out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AT THE sight of Vidura, Yudhishthira&#xA;anxiously inquired: &amp;ldquo;Why are you so&#xA;cheerless? Is it well with all our relations&#xA;in Hastinapura? Are the king and the&#xA;princes well?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vidura acquainted him with his mission:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Everyone in Hastinapura is well. How&#xA;fares it with you all? I have come to invite&#xA;you on behalf of King Dhritarashtra to&#xA;come and see the newly erected hall of&#xA;games. A beautiful hall has been erected&#xA;there even like yours. The king would like&#xA;you to come with your brothers, see&#xA;everything, have a game of dice and&#xA;return to your capital.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira seemed to ask counsel of&#xA;Vidura: &amp;ldquo;Wagering games create quarrels&#xA;among kshatriyas. A wise man will avoid&#xA;them if he can. We are ever abiding by&#xA;your advice. What would you have us&#xA;do?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vidura replied: &amp;ldquo;Everyone is aware that&#xA;the playing of dice is the root of many&#xA;evils. I did my best to oppose this idea.&#xA;Still the king has commanded me to invite&#xA;you and I have come. You may do as you&#xA;like.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Despite this warning, Yudhishthira went&#xA;to Hastinapura with his brothers and&#xA;retinue. It may be asked why the wise&#xA;Yudhishthira responded to the invitation.&#xA;Three reasons may be given. Men rush&#xA;consciously on their ruin impelled by lust,&#xA;gambling and drink. Yudhishthira was&#xA;fond of gambling. The kshatriya tradition&#xA;made it a matter of etiquette and honor not&#xA;to refuse an invitation to a game of dice.There is a third reason too. True to the&#xA;vow he took at the time Vyasa had warned&#xA;him of the quarrels that would arise&#xA;leading to destruction of the race.&#xA;Yudhishthira would not give any occasion&#xA;for displeasure or complaint by refusing&#xA;the invitation of Dhritarashtra.&#xA;These causes conspired with his natural&#xA;inclination to make Yudhishthira accept&#xA;the invitation and go to Hastinapura. The&#xA;Pandavas and their retinue stopped in the&#xA;magnificent palace reserved for them.&#xA;Yudhishthira rested on the day of arrival,&#xA;and after the daily routine of duties, went&#xA;to the hall of games the next morning.&#xA;After the exchange of customary&#xA;greetings,&#xA;Sakuni&#xA;announced&#xA;to&#xA;Yudhishthira that the cloth for playing the&#xA;game had been spread and invited him to&#xA;it.&#xA;Yudhishthira at first said: &amp;ldquo;O king,&#xA;gambling is bad. It is not through heroism&#xA;or merit that one succeeds in a game of&#xA;chance. Asita, Devala and other wise&#xA;rishis who were well-versed in worldly&#xA;affairs have declared that gambling should&#xA;be avoided since it offers scope for deceit.&#xA;They have also said that conquest in battle&#xA;is the proper path for the kshatriyas. You&#xA;are not unaware of it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But a part of himself, weakened by&#xA;addiction to gambling, was at war with his&#xA;judgment and in his heart of hearts&#xA;Yudhishthira desired to play.&#xA;In his discussion with Sakuni, we see this&#xA;inner conflict.&#xA;The keen-witted Sakuni&#xA;spotted this weakness at once and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What is wrong with the game? What, in&#xA;fact, is a battle? What is even a discussion&#xA;between Vedic scholars? The learned man&#xA;wins victory over the ignorant. The better&#xA;man wins in every case. It is just a test of&#xA;strength or skill, that is all, and there is&#xA;nothing wrong in it. As for the result, in&#xA;every field of activity, the expert defeats&#xA;the beginner, and that is what happens in a&#xA;game of dice also. But if you are afraid,&#xA;you need not play. But do not come out&#xA;with this worn excuse of right and&#xA;wrong.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Well, who is to&#xA;play with me?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana&#xA;said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Mine&#xA;is&#xA;the&#xA;responsibility for finding the stakes in the&#xA;form of wealth and gems to play the&#xA;game. My uncle Sakuni will actually cast&#xA;the dice in my stead.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira had thought himself secure&#xA;of defeating Duryodhana in play but&#xA;Sakuni was a different matter, for Sakuni&#xA;was a recognised expert. So he hesitated&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;It is not, I think, customary for&#xA;one man to play on behalf of another.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sakuni retorted tauntingly: &amp;ldquo;I see that you&#xA;are forging another excuse.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira flushed and, casting caution&#xA;to the winds, replied: &amp;ldquo;Well, I shall play.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The hall was fully crowded. Drona, Kripa,&#xA;Bhishma, Vidura, and Dhritarashtra were&#xA;seated there. They knew that the game&#xA;would end viciously and sat unhappily&#xA;witnessing what they could not prevent.&#xA;The assembled princes watched the game&#xA;with great interest and enthusiasm. At first&#xA;they wagered jewels and later gold, silver&#xA;and then chariots and horses. Yudhishthira&#xA;lost continually.&#xA;When he lost all these, Yudhishthira&#xA;staked his servants and lost them also. He&#xA;pledged his elephants and armies and lost&#xA;them too. The dice thrown by Sakuni&#xA;seemed at every time to obey his will.&#xA;Cows, sheep, cities, villages and citizens&#xA;and all other possessions were lost by&#xA;Yudhishthira.&#xA;Still,&#xA;drugged&#xA;with&#xA;misfortune, he would not stop.&#xA;He lost the ornaments of his brothers and&#xA;himself as well as the very clothes they&#xA;wore. Still bad luck dogged him, or rather&#xA;the trickery of Sakuni was too much for&#xA;him.Sakuni asked: &amp;ldquo;Is there anything else that&#xA;you can offer as wager?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira said: &amp;ldquo;Here is the beautiful&#xA;sky-complexioned Nakula. He is one of&#xA;my riches. I place him as a wager.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sakuni replied: &amp;ldquo;Is it so? We shall be glad&#xA;to win your beloved prince.&amp;rdquo; With these&#xA;words Sakuni cast the dice and the result&#xA;was what he had foretold.&#xA;The assembly trembled.&#xA;Yudhishthira said: &amp;ldquo;Here is my brother&#xA;Sahadeva. He is famous for his infinite&#xA;knowledge in all the arts. It is wrong to&#xA;bet him, still I do so. Let us play.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sakuni cast the dice with the words:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Here, I have played and I have&#xA;won.&amp;ldquo;Yudhishthira lost Sahadeva too.&#xA;The wicked Sakuni was afraid that&#xA;Yudhishthira might stop there. So be&#xA;lashed Yudhishthira with these words:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;To you, Bhima and Arjuna, being your&#xA;full brothers, are no doubt dearer than the&#xA;sons of Madri. You will not offer them, I&#xA;know.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira, now thoroughly reckless&#xA;and stung to the quick by the sneering&#xA;imputation that he held his step-brothers&#xA;cheap, replied: &amp;ldquo;Fool, do you seek to&#xA;divide us? How can you, living an evil&#xA;life, understand the righteous life we&#xA;lead?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He continued: &amp;ldquo;I offer as wager the ever-&#xA;victorious&#xA;Arjuna&#xA;who&#xA;successfully&#xA;voyages across oceans of battle. Let us&#xA;play.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sakuni answered: &amp;ldquo;I cast the dice&amp;rdquo; and he&#xA;played. Yudhishthira lost Arjuna also.&#xA;The stubborn madness of unbroken&#xA;misfortune carried Yudhishthira further&#xA;and deeper. With tears in his eyes, he said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O king, Bhima, my brother, is our leader&#xA;in battle. He strikes terror into the heart of&#xA;demons and is equal to Indra; he can&#xA;never suffer the least dishonor and he is&#xA;peerless throughout the world in physical&#xA;strength. I offer him as a bet&amp;rdquo; and he&#xA;played again and lost Bhima too.&#xA;The wicked Sakuni asked: &amp;ldquo;Is there any&#xA;thing else you can offer?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dharmaputra replied: &amp;ldquo;Yes. Here is&#xA;myself. If you win, I shall be your slave.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Look. I win.&amp;rdquo; Thus saying, Sakuni cast&#xA;the dice and won. After that Sakuni stood&#xA;up in the assembly and shouted the names&#xA;of each of the five Pandavas and loudly&#xA;proclaimed that they had all become his&#xA;lawful slaves.&#xA;The assembly looked on in stunned&#xA;silence.&#xA;Sakuni&#xA;alone&#xA;turned&#xA;toYudhishthira and said: &amp;ldquo;There is one&#xA;jewel still in your possession by staking&#xA;which you can yet free yourself. Can you&#xA;not continue the game cffering your wife&#xA;Draupadi as wager?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira despairingly said: &amp;ldquo;I pledge&#xA;her,&amp;rdquo; and he trembled unwittingly.&#xA;There was audible distress and agitation in&#xA;that part of the assembly where the elders&#xA;sat. Soon great shouts of &amp;lsquo;Fie! Fie!&amp;rsquo; arose&#xA;from all sides. The more emotional wept.&#xA;Others perspired, and felt the end of the&#xA;world was come.&#xA;Duryodhana, his brothers and Karna&#xA;shouted with exultation. In that group&#xA;Yuyutsu alone bent his head in shame and&#xA;sorrow and heaved a deep sigh. Sakuni&#xA;cast the dice and shouted again: &amp;ldquo;I have&#xA;won.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At once Duryodhana turned to Vidura and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Go and fetch Draupadi, the beloved&#xA;wife of the Pandavas. She must hence&#xA;forward sweep and clean our house. Let&#xA;her come without delay.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vidura exclaimed: &amp;ldquo;Are you mad that you&#xA;rush to certain destruction? You are&#xA;hanging by a slender thread over a&#xA;bottomless abyss! Drunk with success,&#xA;you do not see it, but it will engulf you!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having thus reprimanded Duryodhana,&#xA;Vidura turned to the assembly and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yudhishthira had no right to stakePanchali as by then he had himself already&#xA;lost his freedom and lost all rights. I see&#xA;that the ruin of the Kauravas is imminent,&#xA;and that, regardless of the advice of their&#xA;friends and well-wishers, the sons of&#xA;Dhritarashtra are on the path to hell.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana was angry at these words of&#xA;Vidura&#xA;and&#xA;told&#xA;Prathikami,&#xA;his&#xA;charioteer: &amp;ldquo;Vidura is jealous of us and he&#xA;is afraid of the Pandavas. But you are&#xA;different. Go forth and bring Draupadi&#xA;immediately.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PRATHIKAMI went to Draupadi as&#xA;ordered by his master. He said to her: &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;revered princess, Yudhishthira fell under&#xA;the spell of the game of dice and has&#xA;wagered and lost even you. Now you&#xA;belong to Duryodhana. I have come by&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s command to take you to&#xA;serve in his household as maid servant,&#xA;which will hereafter be your office.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Draupadi, the spouse of the emperor who&#xA;had&#xA;performed&#xA;Rajasuya,&#xA;was&#xA;dumbfounded, at this strange message.&#xA;She asked: &amp;ldquo;Prathikami, what do you say?&#xA;Which prince would pledge his wife? Had&#xA;he nothing else to pawn?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Prathikami answered: &amp;ldquo;It is because he&#xA;had already lost all other possessions and&#xA;had nothing else left that he played&#xA;offering you as a stake.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then he told her the whole story of how&#xA;Yudhishthira had lost all his wealth and&#xA;had finally betted her, after having first&#xA;forfeited his brothers and himself.&#xA;Though the news was such as to break the&#xA;heart and kill the soul, still, Draupadi soon&#xA;regained her fortitude and, with anger&#xA;blazing from her eyes, said: &amp;ldquo;O charioteer,&#xA;return. Ask of him who played the game&#xA;whether in it he first lost himself, or his&#xA;wife. Ask this question in the open&#xA;assembly. Bring me his answer and then&#xA;you can take me.&amp;rdquo; Prathikami went to the&#xA;assembly and, turning to Yudhishthira,&#xA;asked of him the question put by&#xA;Draupadi.&#xA;Yudhishthira remained speechless.&#xA;Then Duryodhana bade Prathikami bring&#xA;Panchali herself there to question her&#xA;husband. Prathikami went again to&#xA;Draupadi and humbly said: &amp;ldquo;Princess, the&#xA;mean-minded Duryodhana desires you to&#xA;go to the assembly and ask your question&#xA;yourself.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Draupadi answered: &amp;ldquo;No. Return to the&#xA;assembly and put the question and&#xA;demand an answer.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Prathikami did so.&#xA;Enraged, Duryodhana turned to his&#xA;brother Duhsasana and said: &amp;ldquo;This man is&#xA;a fool and is afraid of Bhima. Go and&#xA;fetch Draupadi even if you have to drag&#xA;her here.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus commanded, the wicked Duhsasana&#xA;at once sped with joy on his errand. He&#xA;proceeded to the place where Draupadi&#xA;was, shouting: &amp;ldquo;Come, why do you delay?&#xA;You are now ours. Be not shy, beautiful&#xA;lady. Make yourself agreeable to us, now&#xA;that you have been won by us. Come to&#xA;the assembly&amp;rdquo; and in his impatience, he&#xA;bade as though to take her thither by&#xA;force.&#xA;Panchali rose trembling, heart-stricken&#xA;with sorrow and started to fly for refuge to&#xA;the inner apartments of Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;queen. Duhsasana darted after her, caught&#xA;her by the hair and dragged her to the&#xA;assembly.&#xA;It is with a shudder of repugnance that we&#xA;relate how the sons of Dhritarashtra&#xA;stooped to commit this vilest of deeds.&#xA;As soon as she came to the assembly,&#xA;Draupadi controlled her anguish and&#xA;appealed to the elders gathered there:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;How could you consent to my being&#xA;staked by the king who was himself&#xA;trapped into the game and cheated by&#xA;wicked persons, expert in the art? Sincehe was no longer a free man, how could&#xA;he stake anything at all?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then, stretching out her arms and raising&#xA;her flowing eyes in agonised supplication&#xA;she cried in a voice broken with sobs:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If you have loved and revered the&#xA;mothers who bore you and gave you suck,&#xA;if the honor of wife or sister or daughter&#xA;has been dear to you, if you believe in&#xA;God and dharma, forsake me not in this&#xA;horror more cruel than death&amp;rdquo;&#39;&#xA;At this heart-broken cry, as of a poor fawn&#xA;stricken to death, the elders hung their&#xA;heads in grief and shame. Bhima could&#xA;hold himself no longer. His swelling heart&#xA;found relief in a roar of wrath that shook&#xA;the very walls, and turning to&#xA;Yudhishthira he said bitterly:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Even abandoned professional gamblers&#xA;would not stake the harlots who live with&#xA;them, and you, worse than they, have left&#xA;the daughter of Drupada to the mercy of&#xA;these ruffians. I cannot bear this injustice.&#xA;You are the cause of this great crime.&#xA;Brother Sahadeva, bring fire. I am going&#xA;to set fire to those hands of his which cast&#xA;the dice.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna however remonstrated gently with&#xA;Bhima: &amp;ldquo;You have never before spoken&#xA;thus. The plot devised by our enemies is&#xA;entangling us also in its meshes and&#xA;inciting us to wicked action. We should&#xA;not succumb and play their game.&#xA;Beware.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With a superhuman effort, Bhima&#xA;controlled his anger.&#xA;Vikarna, the son of Dhritarashtra, could&#xA;not bear the sight of the agony of&#xA;Panchali. He rose up and said: &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;Kshatriya heroes, why are you silent? I&#xA;am a mere youth, I know, but your silence&#xA;compels me to speak. Listen. Yudhishthira&#xA;was enticed to this game by a deeply&#xA;plotted invitation and he pledged this lady&#xA;when he had no right to do so, because&#xA;she does not belong to Yudhishthira alone.&#xA;For that reason alone the wager is illegal.&#xA;Besides, Yudhishthira had already lost his&#xA;freedom, and being no longer a free man,&#xA;how could he have a right to offer her as a&#xA;stake? And there is this further objection.&#xA;It was Sakuni who suggested her as a&#xA;pledge, which is against the rules of the&#xA;game, under which neither player may&#xA;demand a specific bet. If we consider all&#xA;these points, we must admit that Panchali&#xA;has not been legally won by us. This is my&#xA;opinion.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When the young Vikarna spoke thus&#xA;courageously, the wisdom given by God&#xA;to the members of the assembly suddenly&#xA;illumined their minds. There were great&#xA;shouts of applause. They shouted:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dharma has been saved. Dharma has&#xA;been saved.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At that moment Karna rose up and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Vikarna, forgetting that there are&#xA;elders in this assembly, you lay down the&#xA;law though you are but a stripling. By&#xA;your ignorance and rashness you are&#xA;injuring the very family which gave you&#xA;birth, just as the flame generated by the&#xA;arani destroys its source, the stick. It is an&#xA;ill bird that fouls its own nest. At the very&#xA;beginning, when Yudhishthira was a free&#xA;man, he forfeited all he possessed and&#xA;that, of course, included Draupadi. Hence,&#xA;Draupadi had already come into Sakuni&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;possession. There is nothing more to be&#xA;said in the matter. Even the clothes they&#xA;have on are now Sakuni&amp;rsquo;s property. O&#xA;Duhsasana, seize the garments of the&#xA;Pandavas and the robes of Draupadi and&#xA;hand them over to Sakuni.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As soon as they heard the cruel words of&#xA;Karna, the Pandavas, feeling that they had&#xA;to stand the test of dharma to the bitter&#xA;end, flung off their upper garments to&#xA;show that they were ready to follow the&#xA;path of honor and right at any cost.&#xA;Seeing this, Duhsasana went to Draupadi&#xA;and made ready to seize her clothes byforce. All earthly aid had failed, and in the&#xA;anguish of utter helplessness, she&#xA;implored divine mercy and succour:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Lord of the World,&amp;rdquo; she wailed, &amp;ldquo;God&#xA;whom I adore and trust, abandon me not&#xA;in this dire plight. You are my sole refuge.&#xA;Protect me.&amp;rdquo; And she fainted away.&#xA;Then, as the wicked Duhsasana started his&#xA;shameful work of pulling at Panchali&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;robes and good men shuddered and&#xA;averted their eyes, even then, in the mercy&#xA;of God a miracle occurred.&#xA;In vain Duhsasana toiled to strip off her&#xA;garments, for as he pulled off each, ever&#xA;fresh garments were seen to clothe her&#xA;body, and soon a great heap of&#xA;resplendent clothes was piled up before&#xA;the assembly till Duhsasana desisted and&#xA;sat down in sheer fatigue.&#xA;The assembly trembled at this marvel and&#xA;good men praised God and wept. Bhima&#xA;with quivering lips, loudly uttered this&#xA;terrible oath: &amp;ldquo;May I never go to the blest&#xA;abode of my ancestors if I do not rend the&#xA;breast and drink the heart&amp;rsquo;s blood of this&#xA;sinful Duhsasana, this shame of the&#xA;Bharata race.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Suddenly, the howling of jackals could be&#xA;heard. Donkeys and carnivorous birds&#xA;began to send forth weird dissonant cries&#xA;from all sides, portending calamities to&#xA;come.&#xA;Dhritarashtra who realised that this&#xA;incident would be the cause of the&#xA;destruction of his race, for once acted with&#xA;wisdom and courage. He called Draupadi&#xA;to his side and attempted to soothe her&#xA;with words of gentleness and affection.&#xA;Then he turned to Yudhishthira and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are so blameless that you can have&#xA;no enemies. Forgive in your magnanimity&#xA;the evil done by Duryodhana and dismiss&#xA;all memory of it from your mind. Take&#xA;back your kingdom and riches and&#xA;everything else and be free and&#xA;prosperous. Return to Indraprastha.&amp;rdquo; And&#xA;the Pandavas left that accursed hall,&#xA;bewildered and stunned, and seeing a&#xA;miracle in this sudden release from&#xA;calamity. But it was too good to endure.&#xA;After Yudhishthira and his brothers had&#xA;departed, there was a long and angry&#xA;discussion in the palace of the Kauravas.&#xA;Incited by Duhsasana, Sakuni and others,&#xA;Duryodhana upbraided his father with&#xA;having frustrated their well-laid plans on&#xA;the very threshold of success.&#xA;He quoted Brihaspati&amp;rsquo;s aphorism that no&#xA;device could be considered wrong which&#xA;had as its object the destruction of&#xA;formidable enemies.&#xA;He spoke in detail on the prowess of the&#xA;Pandavas and expressed his conviction&#xA;that the only hope of overcoming the&#xA;Pandavas lay in guile and taking&#xA;advantage of their pride and sense of&#xA;honor.&#xA;No self-respecting kshatriya could decline&#xA;an invitation to a game of dice.&#xA;Duryodhana secured his doting father&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;reluctant and ominous approval to a plan&#xA;to entice Yudhishthira once again to a&#xA;game of dice.&#xA;A messenger was accordingly dispatched&#xA;after Yudhisthira who had taken his&#xA;departure for Indraprastha. He came up&#xA;with Yudhishthira before the latter had&#xA;reached his destination and invited him on&#xA;behalf of king Dhritarashtra to come back.&#xA;On hearing this invitation, Yudhishthira&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Good and evil come from destiny&#xA;and cannot be avoided. If we must play&#xA;again we must, that is all. A challenge to&#xA;dice cannot in honor be refused. I must&#xA;accept it.&amp;rdquo; Truly, as Sri Vyasa says:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;There never was and never can be an&#xA;antelope of gold! Yet, Rama went in vain&#xA;pursuit of what seemed one. Surely, when&#xA;calamities are imminent, the judgment is&#xA;first destroyed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dharmaputra returned to Hastinapura and&#xA;set again for a game with Sakuni, thougheveryone in the assembly tried to dissuade&#xA;him.&#xA;He seemed a mere pawn moved by Kali to&#xA;relieve the burden of the world.&#xA;The stake played for was that the defeated&#xA;party should go with his brothers into&#xA;exile to the forest and remain there for&#xA;twelve years and spend the thirteenth year&#xA;incognito. If they were recognised in the&#xA;thirteenth year, they should go again into&#xA;exile for twelve years.&#xA;Needless to say, Yudhishthira met with&#xA;defeat on this occasion also, and the&#xA;Pandavas took the vows of those who are&#xA;to go to the forest.&#xA;All the members of the assembly bent&#xA;down their heads in shame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN the Pandavas set out for the forest,&#xA;there arose a great clamor of lamentation&#xA;from people who thronged the streets and&#xA;climbed the roofs and towers and trees to&#xA;see them go.&#xA;The princes, who, of yore, rode in&#xA;jewelled chariots or on lordly elephants to&#xA;strains of auspicious music, now walked&#xA;away from their birthright on weary feet,&#xA;accompanied by weeping crowds. On all&#xA;sides cries arose of: &amp;ldquo;Fie and Alas! Does&#xA;not God see this from His heaven?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The blind Dhritarashtra sent for Vidura&#xA;and asked him to describe the departure of&#xA;the Pandavas into exile. Vidura replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, went with&#xA;his face covered with a cloth. Bhima went&#xA;behind with his eyes lowered on his arms.&#xA;Arjuna proceeded scattering sand on his&#xA;path. Nakula and Sahadeva besmeared&#xA;their bodies with dust and closely&#xA;followed&#xA;Yudhishthira.&#xA;Draupadi&#xA;accompanied&#xA;Dharmaputra,&#xA;her&#xA;dishevelled hair covering her face and her&#xA;eyes streaming with tears. Dhaumya, the&#xA;priest, went along with them singing the&#xA;Sama hymns, addressed to Yama, the&#xA;Lord of Death.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When he heard these words, Dhritarashtra&#xA;was filled with ever-greater fear and&#xA;anxiety than before. He asked: &amp;ldquo;What do&#xA;the citizens say?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vidura answered: &amp;ldquo;O great king, I shall&#xA;tell you in their own words what the&#xA;citizens of all castes and creeds say: &amp;lsquo;Our&#xA;leaders have left us. Fie on the elders of&#xA;the Kuru race who have suffered such&#xA;things&#xA;to&#xA;happen!&#xA;The&#xA;covetous&#xA;Dhritarashtra and his sons have driven&#xA;away the sons of Pandu to the forest.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;While the citizens blame us thus, the&#xA;heavens are vexed with cloudless&#xA;lightning, and the distressed earth quakes,&#xA;and there are other evil portents.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;While Dhritarashtra and Vidura were&#xA;conversing thus, the sage Narada suddenly&#xA;appeared before them. Narada declared:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Fourteen years from this day the&#xA;Kauravas will become extinct as the result&#xA;of the crime committed by Duryodhana&amp;rdquo;&#xA;and vanished from sight.&#xA;Duryodhana and his companions were&#xA;filled with fear and approached Drona&#xA;with a prayer never to abandon them,&#xA;whatever happened.&#xA;Drona answered gravely: &amp;ldquo;I believe with&#xA;the wise that the Pandavas are of divine&#xA;birth and unconquerable. Yet my duty is&#xA;to fight for the sons of Dhritarashtra who&#xA;rely on me and whose salt I eat. I shall&#xA;strive for them, heart and soul. But destiny&#xA;is all-powerful. The Pandavas will surely&#xA;return from exile, burning with anger. I&#xA;should know what anger is, for I&#xA;dethroned and dishonored Drupada on&#xA;account of my anger towards him.&#xA;Implacably revengeful, he has performed&#xA;a sacrifice so that he might be blessed&#xA;with a son who would kill me. It is said&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna is that son. As destiny&#xA;would have it, he is the brother-in-law and&#xA;fast friend of the Pandavas. And things are&#xA;moving as foreordained. Your actions&#xA;tend in the same direction and your daysare numbered. Lose no time in doing good&#xA;while you may; perform great sacrifice,&#xA;enjoy sinless pleasures, give alms to the&#xA;needy. Nemesis will overtake you in the&#xA;fourteenth year. Duryodhana, make peace&#xA;withYudhishthira this is my counsel to&#xA;you. But, of course, you will do what you&#xA;like.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana was not at all pleased with&#xA;these words of Drona.&#xA;Sanjaya asked Dhritarashtra: &amp;ldquo;O king,&#xA;why are you worried?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The blind king replied: &amp;ldquo;How can I know&#xA;peace after having injured the Pandavas?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sanjaya said: &amp;ldquo;What you say is quite true.&#xA;The victim of adverse fate will first&#xA;become perverted, utterly losing his sense&#xA;of right and wrong. Time, the all&#xA;destroyer, does not take a club and break&#xA;the head of a man but by destroying his&#xA;judgment, makes him act madly to his&#xA;own ruin. Your sons have grossly insulted&#xA;Panchali and put themselves on the path&#xA;of destruction.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhritarashtra said: &amp;ldquo;I did not follow the&#xA;wise path of dharma and statesmanship&#xA;but suffered myself to be misled by my&#xA;foolish son and, as you say, we are fast&#xA;hastening towards the abyss.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vidura used to advise Dhritarashtra&#xA;earnestly. He would often tell him: &amp;ldquo;Your&#xA;son has committed a great wrong.&#xA;Dharmaputra has been cheated. Was it not&#xA;your duty to turn your children to the path&#xA;of virtue and pull them away from vice?&#xA;You should order even now that the&#xA;Pandavas get back the kingdom granted to&#xA;them by you. Recall Yudhishthira from&#xA;the forest and make peace with him. You&#xA;should even restrain Duryodhana by force&#xA;if he will not listen to reason.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At first Dhritarashtra would listen in sad&#xA;silence when Vidura spoke thus, for he&#xA;knew Vidura to be a wiser man than&#xA;himself who wished him well. But&#xA;gradually his patience wore thin with&#xA;repeated homilies.&#xA;One day, Dhritarashtra could stand it no&#xA;longer. &amp;ldquo;O Vidura,&amp;rdquo; he burst out, &amp;ldquo;you are&#xA;always speaking for the Pandavas and&#xA;against my sons. You do not seek our&#xA;good. Duryodhana was born of my loins.&#xA;How can I give him up? What is the use&#xA;of advising such an unnatural course? I&#xA;have lost my faith in you and do not need&#xA;you anymore. You are free to go to the&#xA;Pandavas if you like.&amp;rdquo; Then, turning his&#xA;back on Vidura, he retired to the inner&#xA;apartments.&#xA;Vidura&#xA;sorrowfully&#xA;felt&#xA;that&#xA;the&#xA;destruction of the Kuru race was certain&#xA;and, taking Dhritarashtra at his word,&#xA;drove in a chariot with fleet horses to the&#xA;forest where the Pandavas lived.&#xA;Dhritarashtra was filled with anxious&#xA;remorse. He reflected thin himself: &amp;ldquo;What&#xA;have I done? I have only strengthened&#xA;Duryodhana, while driving the wise&#xA;Vidura to the Pandavas.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But later he called for Sanjaya and asked&#xA;him to bear a repentant message to Vidura&#xA;imploring him to forgive the thoughtless&#xA;words of an unhappy father and to return.&#xA;Sanjaya hurried to the hermitage where&#xA;the Pandavas were staying and found&#xA;them clad in deer-skin and surrounded by&#xA;sages.&#xA;He also saw Vidura there and conveyed&#xA;Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s message adding that the&#xA;blind king would die broken-hearted if he&#xA;did not return.&#xA;The soft-hearted Vidura, who was dharma&#xA;incarnate, was greatly moved and returned&#xA;to Hastinapura.&#xA;Dhritarashtra embraced Vidura and the&#xA;difference between them was washed&#xA;away in tears of mutual affection.&#xA;One day, the sage Maitreya came to the&#xA;court of Dhritarashtra and was welcomed&#xA;with great respect.Dhritarashtra craved his blessing and&#xA;asked him: &amp;ldquo;Revered sir, you have&#xA;certainly met my beloved children, the&#xA;Pandavas, in Kurujangala. Are they well?&#xA;Will mutual affection abide in our family&#xA;without any diminution?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Maitreya said: &amp;ldquo;I accidentally met&#xA;Yudhishthira in the Kamyaka forest. The&#xA;sages of the place had come to see him. I&#xA;learnt of the events that took place in&#xA;Hastinapura, and I marvelled that such&#xA;things should have been permitted while&#xA;Bhishma and yourself were alive.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Later, Maitreya saw Duryodhana who was&#xA;also in the court and advised him, for his&#xA;own good, not to injure but to make peace&#xA;with the Pandavas who were not only&#xA;mighty themselves but related to Krishna&#xA;and Drupada.&#xA;The obstinate and foolish Duryodhana&#xA;merely laughed, slapping his thighs in&#xA;derision and, tearing the ground with his&#xA;feet and without granting an answer,&#xA;turned away.&#xA;Maitreya grew angry and looking at&#xA;Duryodhana said: &amp;ldquo;Are you so arrogant&#xA;and do you slap your thighs in derision of&#xA;one who wishes you well? Your thighs&#xA;will be broken by a Bhima&amp;rsquo;s mace and you&#xA;will die on the battlefield.&amp;rdquo; At this&#xA;Dhritarashtra jumped up, fell at the feet of&#xA;the sage and begged forgiveness.&#xA;Maitreya said: &amp;ldquo;My curse will not work if&#xA;your son makes peace with the Pandavas.&#xA;Otherwise it will have effect,&amp;rdquo; and strode&#xA;indignantly out of the assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As SOON as the news of the slaying of&#xA;Sisupala by Krishna reached his friend&#xA;Salva, he became very angry and besieged&#xA;Dwaraka with a mighty force.&#xA;Krishna having not yet returned to&#xA;Dwaraka, old Ugrasena was in charge of&#xA;the defence of the city. The sieges&#xA;described in the Mahabharata seem very&#xA;much like those in wars of the present&#xA;day.&#xA;Dwaraka was a strongly garrisoned&#xA;fortress built on an island and well&#xA;provided with means of defence. Ample&#xA;barracks had been provided and there was&#xA;an abundant supply of food and weapons&#xA;and the garrison included many illustrious&#xA;warriors.&#xA;Ugrasena imposed a stringent ban upon&#xA;drinking and amusements generally for&#xA;the period of the siege. All the bridges&#xA;were demolished and ships were forbidd&#xA;enentry into ports in the realm.&#xA;Iron spikes were planted in the moats&#xA;around the fortress and the city walls kept&#xA;in good repair.&#xA;All entrances to the city were guarded&#xA;with barbed wire and permits and&#xA;passwords strictly controlled ingress and&#xA;egress. Thus no arrangements were&#xA;neglected that could further strengthen the&#xA;city which nature had already made&#xA;impregnable.&#xA;The pay of the soldiers was increased.&#xA;Volunteers for service were rigidly tested&#xA;before being accepted as soldiers.&#xA;The siege was so rigorously pushed that&#xA;the garrison suffered great privations.&#xA;Krishna, when he returned, was struck to&#xA;the heart at the sufferings of his beloved&#xA;city and he compelled Salva immediately&#xA;to raise the siege, by attacking and&#xA;defeating him.&#xA;It was only afterwards that Krishna learnt&#xA;for the first time of the events at&#xA;Hastinapura, the game of dice and the&#xA;exile of the Pandavas. At once be set out&#xA;for the forest where the Pandavas were&#xA;living.&#xA;Along with Krishna went many, including&#xA;men of the Bhoja and Vrishni tribes,&#xA;Dhrishtaketu, the king of the Chedi&#xA;country, and the Kekayas who were all&#xA;devoted to the Pandavas.They&#xA;were&#xA;filled&#xA;with&#xA;righteous&#xA;indignation&#xA;when&#xA;they&#xA;heard&#xA;of&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s perfidy and cried out that&#xA;surely the earth would drink the blood of&#xA;such wicked people.&#xA;Draupadi approached Sri Krishna and, in a&#xA;voice drowned in tears and broken with&#xA;sobs, told the story of her wrongs. She&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;I was dragged to the assembly when&#xA;I had but a single garment on my body.&#xA;The sons of Dhritarashtra insulted me&#xA;most outrageously and gloated over my&#xA;agony. They thought that I had become&#xA;their slave and accosted me and treated&#xA;me as one. Even Bhishma and&#xA;Dhritarashtra forgot my birth and breeding&#xA;and my relationship to them. O&#xA;Janardhana, even my husbands did not&#xA;protect me from the jeers and the ribald&#xA;insults of those foul ruffians. Bhima&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;bodily strength and Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s Gandiva bow&#xA;were alike of no avail. Under such&#xA;supreme provocation even weaklings&#xA;would have found strength and courage to&#xA;strike the vile insulter dead. The Pandavas&#xA;are renowned heroes and yet Duryodhana&#xA;lives! I, the daughter-in-law of the&#xA;emperor Pandu, was dragged by my hair.&#xA;I, the wife of five heroes, was dishonored.&#xA;O Madhusudana, even you had deserted&#xA;me.&amp;rdquo; She stood trembling, utterly unable&#xA;to continue, for the grief convulsed her.&#xA;Krishna was deeply moved and he&#xA;consoled the weeping Draupadi. He said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Those who tormented you will be&#xA;stricken to death in the bloody quagmire&#xA;of a lost battle. Wipe your eyes. I&#xA;solemnly promise that your grievous&#xA;wrongs shall be amply avenged. I shall&#xA;help the Pandavas in every way. You will&#xA;become an empress. The heavens may&#xA;fall, the Himalayas may split in twain, the&#xA;earth may crumble or the boundless sea&#xA;may dry up, but, I tell you verily, my&#xA;words shall stand. I swear this,&amp;rdquo; and&#xA;Krishna took a solemn vow before&#xA;Draupadi.&#xA;This vow, it will be seen, was in perfect&#xA;accord with the purpose of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;avatars, as declared in scriptures:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;For protecting the righteous, for&#xA;destroying the wicked and for firmly&#xA;upholding the law, I am born on earth age&#xA;after age.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna also consoled his sister&#xA;and told her how nemesis would overtake&#xA;the Kauravas.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;I will kill Drona, Sikhandin will&#xA;cause Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s fall. Bhima will take the&#xA;lives of the wicked Duryodhana and his&#xA;brothers. Arjuna will slay Karna, the&#xA;charioteer&amp;rsquo;s son.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sri Krishna said: &amp;ldquo;When this calamity&#xA;befell you, I was in Dwaraka. Had I been&#xA;in Hastinapur, I would never have allowed&#xA;this fraudulent game of dice to take place.&#xA;Uninvited, I would have gone there and&#xA;stirred up Drona, Kripa and the other&#xA;elders to a sense of duty. I would, at all&#xA;costs, have prevented this destructive play&#xA;of dice. When Sakuni was cheating you, I&#xA;was fighting King Salva who had&#xA;besieged my city. It was only after I had&#xA;defeated him that I came to know of the&#xA;game of dice and the subsequent sordid&#xA;story. It grieves me that I am not able to&#xA;remove your sorrows immediately but you&#xA;know, some water must be lost before a&#xA;broken dam is restored.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Krishna took leave and returned to&#xA;Dwaraka with Subhadra, the wife of&#xA;Arjuna, and their child, Abhimanyu.&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna went back to Panchala&#xA;taking with him the sons of Draupadi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IN the beginning of their stay in the forest,&#xA;Bhima and Draupadi used, on occasions,&#xA;to argue with Yudhishthira.&#xA;They would plead that only righteous&#xA;anger befitted a kshatriya and thatpatience and forbearance under slights and&#xA;insults were not worthy of him.&#xA;They would quote weighty authorities and&#xA;argue vehemently in support of their&#xA;contention. Yudhishthira would firmly&#xA;reply that they should abide by the&#xA;promise they had made and that&#xA;forbearance was the highest virtue of all.&#xA;Bhima was burning with impatience to&#xA;attack and kill Duryodhana immediately&#xA;and win back the kingdom. He thought it&#xA;unworthy of warriors to continue to dwell&#xA;tamely in the forest.&#xA;Bhima said to Yudhishthira: &amp;ldquo;You speak&#xA;like those who repeat Vedic mantras and&#xA;are satisfied with the sound of the words&#xA;though ignorant of their meaning. Your&#xA;intellect has become confused. You are&#xA;born as a kshatriya and yet you do not&#xA;think or behave like one. You have&#xA;become a brahmana by temperament. You&#xA;know, the scriptures enjoin on a kshatriya&#xA;sternness and enterprise. We should not&#xA;let the wicked sons of Dhritarashtra have&#xA;their way. Vain is the birth of a kshatriya&#xA;who does not conquer his deceitful&#xA;enemies. This is my opinion, and to me, if&#xA;we go to hell by killing a deceitful foe,&#xA;such hell is heaven. Your forbearance&#xA;burns us worse than fire. It scorches&#xA;Arjuna and myself day and night, making&#xA;us sleepless. Those miscreants have seized&#xA;our kingdom by fraud and are enjoying it,&#xA;while you lie torpid like a gorged python.&#xA;You say that we should abide by our&#xA;promise. How can the world-renowned&#xA;Arjuna live incognito? Can the Himalayas&#xA;be hidden under a handful of grass? How&#xA;can the lion-hearted Arjuna, Nakula and&#xA;Sahadeva live in hiding? Can the famous&#xA;Draupadi walk about unrecognized by&#xA;others? Even if we do these impossible&#xA;things, the son of Dhritarashtra will find&#xA;out through his spies. Hence, this promise&#xA;of ours is impossible of performance and&#xA;has been put on us merely to thrust us out&#xA;again for another thirteen years. The&#xA;sastras too support me when I say that a&#xA;filched promise is no promise. A handful&#xA;of grass thrown to a tired bull ought to be&#xA;enough as expiation for breaking such a&#xA;promise. You should resolve to kill our&#xA;enemies immediately. There is no higher&#xA;duty for a kshatriya.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhima was never tired of pressing his&#xA;view. Draupadi also would refer to the&#xA;dishonor she had suffered at the hands of&#xA;Duryodhana, Karna and Duhsasana and&#xA;would quote authorities from the&#xA;scriptures that would give Yudhishthira&#xA;anxiety to think.&#xA;He would sometimes answer with&#xA;common maxims of politics and refer to&#xA;the relative strength of the parties. He&#xA;would say: &amp;ldquo;Our enemy has such&#xA;adherents&#xA;as&#xA;Bhurisravas,&#xA;Bhishma,&#xA;Drona,&#xA;Karna&#xA;and&#xA;Aswatthama.&#xA;Duryodhana and his brothers are expert in&#xA;warfare. Many feudatory princes, as well&#xA;as mighty monarchs, are now on their&#xA;side. Bhishma and Drona, indeed, have no&#xA;respect for Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s character, but&#xA;will not give him up and are prepared to&#xA;sacrifice their lives on his side in the&#xA;battlefield. Karna is a brave and skilful&#xA;fighter, well versed in the use of all the&#xA;weapons. The course of war is&#xA;unpredictable and success is uncertain.&#xA;There is no use in being hasty.&amp;rdquo; Thus&#xA;Yudhishthira managed with difficulty to&#xA;restrain the impatience of the younger&#xA;Pandavas.&#xA;Later, as advised by Vyasa, Arjuna went&#xA;to the Himalayas to practise austerities for&#xA;the purpose of getting new weapons from&#xA;the devas. Arjuna took leave of his&#xA;brothers and went to Panchali to bid her&#xA;farewell.&#xA;She said: &amp;ldquo;O Dhananjaya, may you&#xA;prosper in your mission. May God give&#xA;you all that Kuntidevi hoped and wished&#xA;for when you were born. The happiness,life, honor and prosperity of us all depend&#xA;on you. Return after acquiring new&#xA;weapons.&amp;rdquo; Thus Panchali sent him forth&#xA;with auspicious words.&#xA;It is noteworthy that though the voice was&#xA;Draupadi the wife&amp;rsquo;s, yet the benediction&#xA;was Kunti the mother&amp;rsquo;s for the words&#xA;were: &amp;ldquo;May God give all that Kuntidevi&#xA;wished and hoped for when you were&#xA;born.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna passed through dense forests and&#xA;reached the mountain of Indrakila, where&#xA;he met an old brahmana. The ascetic&#xA;smiled and spoke affectionately to Arjuna:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Child, you are clad in armor and carry&#xA;weapons. Who are you? Weapons are of&#xA;no use here. What do you seek in this garb&#xA;of a kshatriya in this abode of ascetics and&#xA;saints who have conquered anger and&#xA;passion?&amp;rdquo; That was Indra, the king of&#xA;gods, who came to have the pleasure of&#xA;meeting his son.&#xA;Arjuna bowed to his father and said: &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;seek arms. Bless me with weapons.&amp;rdquo; Indra&#xA;replied: &amp;ldquo;O Dhananjaya, what is the use of&#xA;weapons? Ask for pleasures or seek to go&#xA;to higher worlds for enjoyment.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna answered: &amp;ldquo;O king of gods, I do&#xA;not seek pleasures of higher worlds. I&#xA;have come here after leaving Panchali and&#xA;my brothers in the forest. I seek but&#xA;weapons.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The thousand-eyed said: &amp;ldquo;If you be&#xA;blessed by the vision of god Siva, the&#xA;three-eyed god, and obtain his grace, you&#xA;will receive divine weapons. Do penance&#xA;unto Siva.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus saying Indra disappeared. Then,&#xA;Arjuna went to the Himalayas and did&#xA;penance to obtain the grace of Siva.&#xA;Siva under the guise of a hunter and&#xA;accompanied by his divine spouse&#xA;Umadevi, entered the forest in pursuit of&#xA;game.&#xA;The chase grew fast and furious, and&#xA;presently a wild boar started charging&#xA;Arjuna, who shot an arrow into it with his&#xA;Gandiva bow at the same moment that the&#xA;hunter Siva transfixed it with a shaft from&#xA;his Pinaka bow.&#xA;Arjuna shouted in loud voice: &amp;ldquo;Who are&#xA;you? Why are you ranging in this forest&#xA;with your wife? How dare you shoot at&#xA;the game I had aimed at?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The hunter replied as though in contempt:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This forest, full of game, belongs to us,&#xA;who live in it. You do not look tough&#xA;enough to be a forester. Your limbs and&#xA;bearing bespeak a soft luxurious life. It is&#xA;rather for me to ask what you are doing&#xA;here.&amp;rdquo; He also added that it was his shaft&#xA;that had killed the boar, and that if Arjuna&#xA;thought differently be was welcome to&#xA;fight about it.&#xA;Nothing could please Arjuna better. He&#xA;jumped up and showered snake-like&#xA;arrows at Siva. To his amazement, they&#xA;seemed to have no effect on the hunter&#xA;and fell back hurtless like storm-driven&#xA;rain from a mountain peak.&#xA;When he had no more arrows, he started&#xA;to strike Siva with his bow. But the hunter&#xA;seemed not to heed it and wrenched with&#xA;ease the bow out of Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s hand and&#xA;burst into laughter.&#xA;Arjuna, who had been disarmed with&#xA;humiliating ease by one who seemed an&#xA;ordinary hunter of the forest, was struck&#xA;with amazement, almost amounting to&#xA;doubt. But undaunted, he drew his sword&#xA;and continued the combat.&#xA;The sword was split into pieces on the&#xA;hunter&amp;rsquo;s adamantine frame. There was&#xA;now nothing to do but to grapple with the&#xA;formidable unknown. But here again he&#xA;was outmatched.&#xA;The hunter caught him in an iron clasp so&#xA;close that Arjuna was quite helpless.&#xA;Worsted and overmastered, Arjuna&#xA;humbly sought divine aid and meditated&#xA;on Siva. As he did so, a light broke on histroubled mind, and at once he knew who&#xA;the hunter really was.&#xA;He fell at the feet of the Lord and, in a&#xA;broken voice of repentance and adoration&#xA;he prayed for forgiveness. &amp;ldquo;I forgive you,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Siva smilingly and gave him back his&#xA;Gandiva bow, as well as the other&#xA;weapons, of which he had been deprived.&#xA;He also bestowed on Arjuna the&#xA;marvellous Pasupata weapon.&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s body, battered in the unequal&#xA;combat, was made whole and perfect by&#xA;the divine touch of the three-eyed god and&#xA;became a hundred fold stronger and more&#xA;brilliant than before.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Go to heaven and render dutiful respect&#xA;to your father Indra,&amp;rdquo; said Siva and&#xA;vanished from view like the setting sun.&#xA;Arjuna was overcome with joy and&#xA;exclaimed: &amp;ldquo;Have I really seen the Lord&#xA;face to face and have I been blessed with&#xA;his divine touch? What more do I need?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At that moment, Matali, the charioteer of&#xA;Indra, came there with his chariot and&#xA;took Arjuna to the kingdom of the gods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BALARAMA and Krishna came with&#xA;their retinue to the abode of the Pandavas&#xA;in the forest. Deeply distressed by what he&#xA;saw, Balarama said to Krishna:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Krishna, it would seem that virtue and&#xA;wickedness bear contrary fruit in this life.&#xA;For see, the wicked Duryodhana is ruling&#xA;his kingdom clad in silk and gold, while&#xA;the virtuous Yudhishthira lives in the&#xA;forest wearing the bark of trees. Seeing&#xA;such unmerited prosperity and undeserved&#xA;privation, men have lost their faith in God.&#xA;The praise of virtue in the sastras seems&#xA;mere mummery when we see the actual&#xA;results of good and evil in this world.&#xA;How will Dhritarashtra justify his conduct&#xA;and defend himself when he is face to face&#xA;with the god of death? Even the&#xA;mountains and the earth weep at the sight&#xA;of the blameless Pandavas dwelling in the&#xA;forests with the blessed Draupadi, born&#xA;from the sacrificial fire.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Satyaki, who was seated near, said: &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;Balarama, this is no time for lamenting.&#xA;Should we wait till Yudhishthira asks us&#xA;to do our duty for the Pandavas? While&#xA;you and Krishna and all other relations are&#xA;living, why should the Pandavas waste&#xA;their precious years in the forest? Let us&#xA;collect our forces and attack Duryodhana.&#xA;With the army of the Vrishnis, we are&#xA;surely strong enough to destroy the&#xA;Kauravas. Why, where is the need to foil&#xA;Karna&amp;rsquo;s vaunted archery and cut off his&#xA;head. Let us kill Duryodhana and his&#xA;adherents in the battlefield and hand over&#xA;the kingdom to Abhimanyu if the&#xA;Pandavas wish to keep their word and stay&#xA;in the forest. This is good for them and&#xA;befits us as men of valor.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vasudeva, who was listening carefully to&#xA;this speech, said: &amp;ldquo;What you say is true.&#xA;But the Pandavas would not like to&#xA;receive from the hands of others what they&#xA;have not won by their own efforts.&#xA;Draupadi for one, born of a heroic race as&#xA;she is, would not hear of it. Yudhishthira&#xA;will never give up the path of&#xA;righteousness for love or fear. When the&#xA;stipulated period of exile is over the kings&#xA;of Panchala, Kekaya and Chedi and&#xA;ourselves will unite our forces to help the&#xA;Pandavas to conquer their enemies.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira was delighted at these words&#xA;of Krishna. &amp;ldquo;Sri Krishna knows my mind,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said he. &amp;ldquo;Truth is greater than power or&#xA;prosperity and has to be guarded at all&#xA;costs and not the kingdom. When he&#xA;wants us to fight, he shall find us ready.&#xA;The heroes of the Vrishni race may now&#xA;return with the certainty that we shall&#xA;meet again when the time is ripe.&amp;rdquo; With&#xA;these words Yudhishthira gave them leave&#xA;to return.&#xA;Arjuna was still away in the Himalayas&#xA;and Bhima&amp;rsquo;s anxiety and impatiencebecame well nigh insupportable. He said&#xA;to Yudhishthira:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You know that our life depends on&#xA;Arjuna. He has been away very long, and&#xA;we have had no tidings of him. If he&#xA;should be lost to us, then neither the king&#xA;of Panchala, nor Satyaki nor even Sri&#xA;Krishna can save us, and I for one cannot&#xA;survive that loss. All this we owe to that&#xA;mad game of dice, our sorrows and&#xA;sufferings, as well as the growing strength&#xA;of our foes. To be dwelling in the forest is&#xA;not the duty enjoined on a kshatriya. We&#xA;should immediately recall Arjuna and&#xA;wage war with the sons of Dhritarashtra,&#xA;with the help of Sri Krishna. I shall be&#xA;satisfied only when the wicked Sakuni,&#xA;Karna and Duryodhana are slain. After&#xA;this clear duty is done, you may, if you&#xA;like, return to the forest and live a life of&#xA;asceticism. It is not a sin to kill by&#xA;stratagem an enemy who has resorted to&#xA;stratagem. I have heard that the Atharva&#xA;Veda has incantations, which can&#xA;compress time and reduce its span. If we&#xA;could, by such means, squeeze thirteen&#xA;years into thirteen days, we would be&#xA;perfectly justified in doing so, and you&#xA;will permit me on the fourteenth day to&#xA;kill Duryodhana.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing&#xA;these&#xA;words&#xA;of&#xA;Bhima,&#xA;Dharmaputra affectionately embraced him&#xA;and sought to restrain his impetuosity.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Beloved brother, as soon as the period of&#xA;thirteen years is over, Arjuna, the hero,&#xA;with the Gandiva bow, and yourself will&#xA;fight and kill Duryodhana. Be patient till&#xA;then. Duryodhana and his followers, who&#xA;are sunk in sin, cannot escape. Be assured&#xA;of it.&amp;rdquo; While the sorrow-stricken brothers&#xA;were thus engaged in debate, the great&#xA;sage Brihadaswa came to the hermitage of&#xA;the Pandavas and was received with the&#xA;customary honors.&#xA;After a while, Yudhishthira said to him:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Revered sage, our deceitful enemies,&#xA;drew us into this game of dice and cheated&#xA;us of our kingdom and riches, and drove&#xA;my heroic brothers, as well as Panchali&#xA;and myself, to the forest. Arjuna, who left&#xA;us a long time ago to get divine weapons,&#xA;has not returned as yet and we miss him&#xA;sorely. Will he return with divine arms?&#xA;And when will he be back? Surely never&#xA;was there in this world a man who&#xA;suffered so much sorrow as myself.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The great sage replied: &amp;ldquo;Do not let your&#xA;mind dwell on sorrow. Arjuna will return&#xA;with divine weapons and you will conquer&#xA;your enemies in the fitness of time. You&#xA;say that there is no one in this world that&#xA;is as unfortunate as you. Now, that is not&#xA;true, though everyone, tried by adversity,&#xA;is inclined to claim pre-eminence in&#xA;sorrow, because things felt are more than&#xA;things heard or seen. Have you heard of&#xA;king Nala of Nishadha? He suffered more&#xA;sorrows than yourself even in the forest.&#xA;He was deceived by Pushkara at a game&#xA;of dice. He lost his wealth and kingdom&#xA;and had to go in exile to the forest. Less&#xA;fortunate than you, he had not with him&#xA;his brothers or brahmanas. The influence&#xA;of Kali, the spirit of the dark age, deprived&#xA;him of his discrimination and good sense.&#xA;And not knowing what he was doing, he&#xA;deserted his wife who had accompanied&#xA;him, and wandered about in the forest,&#xA;solitary and almost mad. Now, compare&#xA;your state with his. You have the&#xA;company of your heroic brothers and&#xA;devoted wife and are supported by a few&#xA;learned brahmanas in your adversity.&#xA;Your mind is sound and steady. Self-pity&#xA;is natural, but you are really not so badly&#xA;off.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The sage then narrated the life of Nala&#xA;which constitutes twenty-eight chapters of&#xA;the great epic. The sage concluded with&#xA;these words:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Pandava, Nala was tried by sorrows&#xA;more agonising than yours, yet hetriumphed over them all and his life ended&#xA;happily. You have the alleviations of&#xA;unclouded intellect and the society of your&#xA;nearest and dearest. You spend much of&#xA;your time in exalted contemplation of&#xA;dharma and in holy converse with&#xA;brahmanas who are learned in the Vedas&#xA;and Vedantas. Bear your trials and&#xA;tribulations with fortitude, for they are the&#xA;lot of man and not peculiar to you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus did the sage Brihadaswa console&#xA;Yudhishthira.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE brahmanas, who had been with&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;in&#xA;Indraprastha,&#xA;had&#xA;followed him to the forest. It was difficult&#xA;to maintain such a large establishment.&#xA;Some time after Arjuna had gone on his&#xA;quest of Pasupata, a brahmana sage named&#xA;Lomasa came to the abode of the&#xA;Pandavas.&#xA;He advised Yudhishthira to minimize his&#xA;retinue before going on pilgrimage as it&#xA;would be difficult to move freely from&#xA;place to place with a large following.&#xA;Yudhishthira, who had long felt that&#xA;difficulty, announced to his followers that&#xA;such of them, as were unaccustomed to&#xA;hardship and to hard and scanty fare and&#xA;those who had followed merely in token&#xA;of loyalty, might return to Dhritarashtra&#xA;or, if they preferred it, go to Drupada, the&#xA;King of Panchala.&#xA;Later, with a greatly reduced retinue, the&#xA;Pandavas started on a pilgrimage to holy&#xA;places, acquainting themselves with the&#xA;stories and traditions relating to each. The&#xA;story of Agastya was one such.&#xA;Agastya, it is said, once saw some&#xA;ancestral spirits dangling head down and&#xA;asked them who they were and how they&#xA;had come to be in that unpleasant plight.&#xA;They replied: &amp;ldquo;Dear child, we are your&#xA;ancestors. If you discharge not your debt&#xA;to us by marrying and begetting progeny,&#xA;there will be no one after you to offer us&#xA;oblations. We have, therefore, resorted to&#xA;this austerity, in order to persuade you to&#xA;save us from this peril.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Agastya heard this, he decided to&#xA;marry.&#xA;The king of the country of Vidarbha was&#xA;childless and, so, careworn. He repaired to&#xA;Agastya to get his blessing. In granting&#xA;him the boon, Agastya announced that the&#xA;king would be the father of a beautiful&#xA;girl, who, he stipulated should be given in&#xA;marriage to him.&#xA;Soon the queen gave birth to a girl who&#xA;was named Lopamudra. She grew with&#xA;years into a maiden of such rare beauty&#xA;and charm that she became celebrated in&#xA;the kshatriya world. But no prince dared&#xA;to woo her for fear of Agastya.&#xA;Later, the sage Agastya came to Vidarbha&#xA;and demanded the hand of the king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;daughter. The king was reluctant to give&#xA;the delicately nurtured princess in&#xA;marriage to a sage leading the primitive&#xA;life of a forester but he also feared the&#xA;anger of the sage if he said nay, and was&#xA;plunged in sorrow.&#xA;Lopamudra, greatly concerned, discovered&#xA;the cause of her parent&amp;rsquo;s unhappiness and&#xA;expressed her readiness, nay her desire, to&#xA;marry the sage.&#xA;The king was relieved, and the marriage&#xA;of Agastya and Lopamudra was celebrated&#xA;in due course. When the princess set out&#xA;to accompany the sage, he bade her give&#xA;up her costly garments and valuable&#xA;jewels.&#xA;Unquestioningly Lopamudra distributed&#xA;her priceless jewels and garments amongst&#xA;her companions and attendants, and&#xA;covering herself in deerskin and garments&#xA;of bark, she joyfully accompanied the&#xA;sage.&#xA;During the time Lopamudra and Agastya&#xA;spent in tapas and meditation at&#xA;Gangadwara, a strong and abiding love&#xA;sprang up between them. For conjugallife, Lopamudra&amp;rsquo;s modesty shrank from&#xA;the lack of privacy in a forest hermitage.&#xA;And one day, with blushing and&#xA;humbleness she expressed her mind to her&#xA;husband.&#xA;She said: &amp;ldquo;My desire is that I may have&#xA;the royal bedding, the beautiful robes and&#xA;the valuable jewels I had when I was in&#xA;my father&amp;rsquo;s place and that you too may&#xA;have splendid garments and ornaments.&#xA;And then we shall enjoy life to our heart&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;content.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Agastya smilingly replied: &amp;ldquo;I have neither&#xA;the wealth nor the facilities to provide&#xA;what you want. Are we not beggars living&#xA;in the forest?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Lopamudra knew her lord&amp;rsquo;s yogic&#xA;power, and said: &amp;ldquo;Lord, you are all-&#xA;powerful by the strength of your&#xA;austerities. You can get the wealth of the&#xA;whole world in a moment if you but will.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Agastya said that no doubt that was so,&#xA;but, if he spent his austerities in gaining&#xA;things of such little moment as riches,&#xA;they would soon dwindle to nothing.&#xA;She replied: &amp;ldquo;I do not wish that. What I&#xA;desire is that you should earn in the&#xA;ordinary way sufficient wealth for us to&#xA;live in ease and comfort.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Agastya consented and set out as an&#xA;ordinary brahmana to beg of various&#xA;kings. Agastya went to a king who was&#xA;reputed to be very wealthy. The sage told&#xA;the king: &amp;ldquo;I have come in quest of wealth.&#xA;Give me what I seek, without causing any&#xA;loss or injury to others.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The king presented a true picture of the&#xA;income and expenditure of the State and&#xA;told him he was free to take what he&#xA;deemed fit. The sage found from the&#xA;accounts that there was no balance left.&#xA;The expenditure of a State turns out&#xA;always to be at least equal to its income.&#xA;This seems to have been the case in&#xA;ancient times also.&#xA;Seeing this, Agastya said: &amp;ldquo;To accept any&#xA;gift from this king, will be a hardship to&#xA;the citizens. So, I shall seek elsewhere,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;and the sage was about to leave. The king&#xA;said that he would also accompany him&#xA;and both of them went to another State&#xA;where also they found the same state of&#xA;affairs.&#xA;Vyasa thus lays down and illustrates the&#xA;maxim that a king should not tax his&#xA;subjects more than necessary for rightful&#xA;public expenditure and that if one accepts&#xA;as gift anything from the public revenues,&#xA;one adds to the burden of the subjects to&#xA;that extent.&#xA;Agastya thought he had better go to the&#xA;wicked asura Ilvala and try his luck.&#xA;Ilvala and his brother Vatapi cherished an&#xA;implacable hatred towards brahmanas.&#xA;They had curious plan for killing them.&#xA;Ilvala would, with effective hospitality,&#xA;invite a brahmana to a feast.&#xA;By the power of his magic he would&#xA;transform his brother Vatapi into a goat&#xA;and he would kill this pseudo-goat for&#xA;food and serve its meat to the guest. In&#xA;those days, the brahmanas used to eat&#xA;meat. The feast over, Ilvala would invoke&#xA;his brother Vatapi to come out, for he had&#xA;the art of bringing back to life those&#xA;whom he had killed.&#xA;And Vatapi, who as food had entered the&#xA;vitals of the unlucky brahmana, would&#xA;spring up sound and whole and rend his&#xA;way out with fiendish laughter, of course&#xA;killing the guest in doing so.&#xA;In this manner, many brahmanas had died.&#xA;Ilvala was very happy when he learnt that&#xA;Agastya was in the neighborhood, since&#xA;he felt that here was a good brahmana&#xA;delivered into his hands.&#xA;So, he welcomed him and prepared the&#xA;usual feast. The sage ate heartily of Vatapi&#xA;transformed into a goat, and it only&#xA;remained for Ilvala to call out Vatapi for&#xA;the rending scene. And, as usual, Ilvalarepeated the magic formula and shouted:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Vatapi come out!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Agastya smiled and, gently rubbing his&#xA;stomach, said: &amp;ldquo;O Vatapi, be digested in&#xA;my stomach for the peace and good of the&#xA;world.&amp;rdquo; Ilvala shouted again and again in&#xA;frantic fear: &amp;ldquo;O Vatapi, come forth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;There was no response and the sage&#xA;explained the reason. Vatapi had been&#xA;digested. The trick had been tried once too&#xA;often.&#xA;The asura bowed to Agastya and&#xA;surrendered to him the riches he sought.&#xA;Thus was the sage able to satisfy&#xA;Lopamudra&amp;rsquo;s desire. Agastya asked her&#xA;what she would prefer whether ten&#xA;ordinarily good sons or one super-good&#xA;son with the strength of ten.&#xA;Lopamudra replied she would like to have&#xA;one exceptionally virtuous and learned&#xA;son. The story goes that she was blessed&#xA;with such a gifted son.&#xA;Once the Vindhyas became jealous of the&#xA;Meru Mountain and tried to grow in&#xA;stature, obstructing the sun, the moon and&#xA;the planets. Unable to prevent this danger,&#xA;the gods sought aid from Agastya. The&#xA;sage went to the Vindhya Mountain and&#xA;said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Best of mountains, stop you’re growing&#xA;till I cross you on my way to the south and&#xA;return north again. After my return, you&#xA;can grow, as you like. Wait till then.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Since the Vindhya Mountain respected&#xA;Agastya, it bowed to his request.&#xA;Agastya did not return north at all, but&#xA;settled in the south and so the Vindhyas&#xA;remain arrested in growth to this day.&#xA;Such is the story as narrated in the&#xA;Mahabharata.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IT is an error to think that it is easy for a&#xA;person to lead a life of chastity if he is&#xA;brought up in complete ignorance of&#xA;sensual pleasures. Virtue guarded only by&#xA;ignorance is very insecure as illustrated by&#xA;the following story. It is told in the&#xA;Ramayana also, but not in the same detail.&#xA;Vibhandaka who was resplendent like&#xA;Brahma, the Creator, lived with his son&#xA;Rishyasringa in a forest. The latter had not&#xA;come across any mortal, man or woman,&#xA;except his father.&#xA;The country of Anga was once afflicted&#xA;with a dire famine. Crops had withered for&#xA;want of rain and men perished for lack of&#xA;food. All living things were in distress.&#xA;Romapada, the king of the country,&#xA;approached the brahmanas to advise him&#xA;of some means of saving the kingdom&#xA;from famine.&#xA;The brahmanas replied: &amp;ldquo;Best of kings,&#xA;there is a young sage called Rishyasringa&#xA;who lives a life of perfect chastity. Invite&#xA;him to our kingdom. He has won the&#xA;power, by his austerities, of bringing rain&#xA;and plenty wherever he goes.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The king discussed with his courtiers the&#xA;means by which Rishyasringa could be&#xA;brought from the hermitage of the sage&#xA;Vibhandaka. In accordance with their&#xA;advice, he called together the most&#xA;charming courtesans of the city and&#xA;entrusted them with the mission of&#xA;bringing Rishyasringa to Anga.&#xA;The damsels were in a quandary. On the&#xA;one hand, they feared to disobey the king.&#xA;On the other, they also feared the sage&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;wrath. Finally, they made up their minds&#xA;to go, relying on Providence to help them,&#xA;in achieving the good work of rescuing&#xA;the stricken land from famine.&#xA;They were suitably equipped for their&#xA;enterprise before being sent to the&#xA;hermitage. The leader of this band of&#xA;courtesans made a beautiful garden of a&#xA;big boat, with artificial trees and creepers,&#xA;with an imitation ashrama in the center.&#xA;She had the boat moored in the river near&#xA;Vibhandaka&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;hermitage,&#xA;and&#xA;the&#xA;courtesans visited the hermitage with&#xA;quaking hearts. Luckily for them, the sagewas not at home. Feeling that this was the&#xA;opportune moment, one of the beautiful&#xA;damsels went to the sage&amp;rsquo;s son.&#xA;She thus addressed Rishyasringa: &amp;ldquo;Great&#xA;sage, are you well? Have you sufficient&#xA;roots and fruits? Are the penances of the&#xA;rishis&#xA;of&#xA;the&#xA;forest&#xA;proceeding&#xA;satisfactorily? Is your father&amp;rsquo;s glory&#xA;constantly growing? Is your own study of&#xA;the Vedas progressing?&amp;rdquo; This was how&#xA;rishis used to accost one another in those&#xA;days.&#xA;The youthful anchorite had never before&#xA;seen such a beautiful human form or heard&#xA;such a sweet voice.&#xA;The instinctive yearning for society,&#xA;especially of the opposite sex, though he&#xA;had never seen a woman before, began to&#xA;work on his mind from the moment he&#xA;beheld that graceful form.&#xA;He thought that she was a young sage like&#xA;himself, and felt a strange irrepressible joy&#xA;surging up in his soul. He answered,&#xA;fixing eyes on his interlocutor:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You seem to be a bright brahmacharin.&#xA;Who are you? I bow to you. Where is&#xA;your hermitage? What are the austerities&#xA;you are practising?&amp;rdquo; and he rendered her&#xA;the customary offerings.&#xA;She said to him: &amp;ldquo;At a distance of three&#xA;yojanas from here is my ashrama. I have&#xA;brought fruits for you. I am not fit to&#xA;receive your prostration, but I shall return&#xA;your greetings and salutation in the way&#xA;customary with us.&amp;rdquo; She embraced him&#xA;warmly, fed him with the sweets she had&#xA;brought, decorated him with perfumed&#xA;garlands, and served him with drinks.&#xA;She embraced him again, saying that that&#xA;was their way of salutation to honored&#xA;guests. He thought it a very agreeable&#xA;way.&#xA;Shortly after, fearing the return of the sage&#xA;Vibhandaka, the courtesan took her leave&#xA;of Rishyasringa saying it was time for her&#xA;to perform the agnihotra sacrifice and&#xA;gently slipped out of the hermitage.&#xA;When Vibhandaka returned to the&#xA;hermitage, he was shocked to see the&#xA;place so untidy with sweet meats scattered&#xA;all over, for the hermitage had not been&#xA;cleansed. The shrubs and creepers looked&#xA;draggled and untidy.&#xA;His son&amp;rsquo;s face had not its usual lustre but&#xA;seemed clouded and disturbed as by a&#xA;storm of passion. The usual simple duties&#xA;of the hermitage had been neglected.&#xA;Vibhandaka was troubled and asked his&#xA;son: &amp;ldquo;Dear boy, why have you not yet&#xA;gathered the sacred firewood? Who has&#xA;broken these nice plants and shrubs? Has&#xA;the cow been milked? Has anyone been&#xA;here to serve you? Who gave you this&#xA;strange garland? Why do you appear&#xA;worried?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The simple and ingenuous Rishyasringa&#xA;replied: &amp;ldquo;A brahmacharin of wonderful&#xA;form was here. I cannot describe his&#xA;brightness and beauty or the sweetness of&#xA;his voice. My inner being has been filled&#xA;with indescribable happiness and affection&#xA;by listening to his voice and looking at his&#xA;eyes. When he embraced me, which it&#xA;seems is his customary greeting, I&#xA;experienced a joy which I have never felt&#xA;before, no, not even when eating the&#xA;sweetest fruits,&amp;rdquo; and then he described to&#xA;his father the form, beauty and the doings&#xA;of his fair visitor.&#xA;Rishyasringa added wistfully: &amp;ldquo;My body&#xA;seems to burn with desire for the company&#xA;of that brahmacharin and I should like to&#xA;go and find him and bring him here&#xA;somehow. How can I give you any idea&#xA;about his devotion and brightness? My&#xA;heart pants to see him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Rishyasringa had thus brokenly&#xA;expressed yearnings and disturbances to&#xA;which he had hitherto been a stranger,&#xA;Vibhandaka knew what had occurred. He&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Child, this was no brahmacharinthat you saw, but a malignant demon who&#xA;sought, as demons do, to beguile us and&#xA;hinder our penances and austerities. They&#xA;take recourse to many kinds of tricks and&#xA;stratagems for the purpose. Do not let&#xA;them come near you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After that Vibhandaka searched in vain&#xA;for three days in the forest to find out the&#xA;wretches who had done this injury, and&#xA;returned baffled it his purpose.&#xA;On another occasion, when Vibhandaka&#xA;had gone out of the hermitage to bring&#xA;roots and fruits, the courtesan again came&#xA;softly to the place where Rishyasringa&#xA;was seated. As soon as he saw her at a&#xA;distance, Rishyasringa jumped up and ran&#xA;to greet her gushingly, as pent up water&#xA;surges out of a reservoir that has sprung a&#xA;leak.&#xA;Even without waiting for prompting this&#xA;time, Rishyasringa went near her and after&#xA;the customary salutation said: &amp;ldquo;O shining&#xA;brahmacharin, before my father returns let&#xA;us go to your hermitage.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This was just what she had hoped and&#xA;worked for. And together they entered the&#xA;boat, which had been made to look like a&#xA;hermitage. As soon as the young sage had&#xA;entered, the boat was freed from its&#xA;moorings and floated easily down with its&#xA;welcome freight to the kingdom of Anga.&#xA;As might be expected, the young sage had&#xA;a pleasant and interesting journey and&#xA;when he reached Anga, he certainly knew&#xA;more about the world and its ways than he&#xA;had done in the forest.&#xA;The coming of Rishyasringa delighted&#xA;Romapada infinitely and he took his&#xA;welcome guest to the luxuriously provided&#xA;inner apartments specially prepared for&#xA;him.&#xA;As foretold by the brahmanas, rain began&#xA;to pour the instant Rishyasringa set his&#xA;foot in the country. The rivers and the&#xA;lakes were full and the people rejoiced.&#xA;Romapada gave his daughter Shanta in&#xA;marriage to Rishyasringa.&#xA;Though all ended as he had planned, the&#xA;king was uneasy in his mind, for he was&#xA;afraid that Vibhandaka might come in&#xA;search of his son and pronounce a curse&#xA;on him.&#xA;So, he sought to mollify Vibhandaka by&#xA;lining the route he would take with cattle&#xA;and kind and by instructing the cowherds&#xA;in charge to say that they were&#xA;Rishyasringa&amp;rsquo;s servants and had come to&#xA;welcome and honor their master&amp;rsquo;s father&#xA;and place themselves at his service.&#xA;Not finding his son anywhere in the&#xA;hermitage, the enraged Vibhandaka&#xA;thought that this might be the work of the&#xA;king of Anga.&#xA;He crossed intervening rivers and villages&#xA;and marched to the capital of the king as if&#xA;to burn him in his anger. But as at each&#xA;stage of the journey he saw magnificent&#xA;cattle which belonged to his son and was&#xA;respectfully welcomed by his son&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;servants, his angry mood passed gradually&#xA;as he approached the capital.&#xA;When he came to the capital, he was&#xA;received with great honor and taken to the&#xA;king&amp;rsquo;s palace where he saw his son sitting&#xA;in state like the king of the gods in&#xA;heaven. He saw by his side his wife, the&#xA;princess Shanta, whose great beauty&#xA;soothed and pleased him.&#xA;Vibhandaka blessed the king. He laid this&#xA;injunction on his son: &amp;ldquo;Do all that will&#xA;please this king. After the birth of a son,&#xA;come and join me in the forest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rishyasringa did as his father bade him.&#xA;Lomasa concluded the story with these&#xA;words addressed to Yudhishthira: &amp;ldquo;Like&#xA;Damayanti and Nala, Sita and Rama,&#xA;Arundhati and Vasishtha, Lopamudra and&#xA;Agastya, and Draupadi and yourself,&#xA;Shanta and Rishyasringa repaired to the&#xA;forest in the fullness of time and spent&#xA;their lives in mutual love and the worshipof God. This is the hermitage where&#xA;Rishyasringa. lived. Bathe in these waters&#xA;and be purified.&amp;rdquo; The Pandavas bathed&#xA;there and performed their devotions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IN the course of their wanderings, the&#xA;Pandavas reached the hermitage of&#xA;Raibhya on the banks of the Ganga.&#xA;Lomasa told them the story of the place:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This is the ghat where Bharata, the son of&#xA;Dasaratha, bathed. These waters cleansed&#xA;Indra of the sin of killing Vritra unfairly.&#xA;Here also Sanatkumara became one with&#xA;God. Aditi, the mother of the gods,&#xA;offered oblations on this mountain and&#xA;prayed to be blessed with a son. O&#xA;Yudhishthira, ascend this holy mountain&#xA;and the misfortunes, which have cast a&#xA;cloud on your life, will vanish. Anger and&#xA;passion will be washed off if you bathe in&#xA;the running waters of this river.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Lomasa expatiated in greater detail&#xA;on the sanctity of the place.&#xA;He began the story thus: &amp;ldquo;Yavakrida, the&#xA;son of a sage, met with destruction in this&#xA;very place.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He continued: &amp;ldquo;There lived in their&#xA;hermitages two eminent brahmanas,&#xA;named Bharadwaja and Raibhya, who&#xA;were dear friends. Raibhya and his two&#xA;sons, Paravasu and Arvavasu, learnt the&#xA;Vedas and became famed scholars.&#xA;Bharadwaja devoted himself wholly to the&#xA;worship of God. He had a son named&#xA;Yavakrida who saw with jealousy and&#xA;hatred that the brahmanas did not respect&#xA;his ascetic father as they did the learned&#xA;Raibhya.&#xA;Yavakrida&#xA;practised&#xA;hard&#xA;penance to gain the grace of Indra. He&#xA;tortured his body with austerities and thus&#xA;awakened the compassion of Indra, who&#xA;appeared and asked him why he so&#xA;mortified his flesh.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yavakrida replied: &amp;ldquo;I wish to be more&#xA;learned in the Vedas than any has ever&#xA;been before. I wish to be a great scholar. I&#xA;am performing these austerities to realise&#xA;that desire. It takes a long time and&#xA;involves much hardship to learn the Vedas&#xA;from a teacher. I am practising austerities&#xA;to acquire that knowledge directly. Bless&#xA;me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Indra smiled and said: &amp;ldquo;O brahmana, you&#xA;are on the wrong path. Return home, seek&#xA;a proper preceptor and learn the Vedas&#xA;from him. Austerity is not the way to&#xA;learning. The path is study and study&#xA;alone.&amp;rdquo; With these words Indra vanished.&#xA;But the son of Bharadwaja would not give&#xA;up.&#xA;He pursued his course of austerities with&#xA;even greater rigor, to the horror and the&#xA;distress of the gods. Indra again&#xA;manifested himself before Yavakrida and&#xA;warned him again:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You have taken the wrong path to&#xA;acquire knowledge. You can acquire&#xA;knowledge only by study. Your father&#xA;learnt the Vedas by patient study and so&#xA;can you. Go and study the Vedas. Desist&#xA;from this vain mortification of the body.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yavakrida did not heed even this second&#xA;warning of Indra and announced defiantly&#xA;that if his prayer were not granted, he&#xA;would cut off his limbs one by one and&#xA;offer them as oblations to the fire. No, he&#xA;would never give up.&#xA;He continued his penance. One morning,&#xA;during his austerities, when he went to&#xA;bathe in the Ganga, be saw a gaunt old&#xA;brahmana on the bank, laboriously&#xA;throwing handfuls of sand into the water.&#xA;Yavakrida asked: &amp;ldquo;Old man, what are you&#xA;doing?&amp;rdquo; The old man replied: &amp;ldquo;I am going&#xA;to build a dam across this river. When,&#xA;with handful after handful, I have built a&#xA;dam of sand here, people can cross the&#xA;river with ease. See how very difficult it is&#xA;at present to cross it. Useful work, isn&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;it?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yavakrida laughed and said: &amp;ldquo;What a fool&#xA;you must be to think you can build a damacross this mighty river with your silly&#xA;handfuls of sand! Arise and take to some&#xA;more useful work.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The old man said: &amp;ldquo;Is my project more&#xA;foolish than yours of mastering the Vedas&#xA;not by study but by austerities?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yavakrida now knew that the old man was&#xA;Indra. More humble this time, Yavakrida&#xA;earnestly begged Indra to grant him&#xA;learning as a personal boon.&#xA;Indra blessed, and comforted Yavakrida&#xA;with the following words:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Well, I grant you the boon you seek. Go&#xA;and study the Vedas; you will become&#xA;learned.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YAVAKRIDA studied the Vedas and&#xA;became learned. He grew vain with the&#xA;thought that he had acquired the&#xA;knowledge of the Vedas through the boon&#xA;of Indra and not through human tutelage.&#xA;Bharadwaja did not like this and feared&#xA;that his son might ruin himself by&#xA;slighting Raibhya. He thought it necessary&#xA;to warm him. &amp;ldquo;The gods,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;grant&#xA;boons to foolish people who persistently&#xA;practise penances, as intoxicants are sold&#xA;to fools for money. They lead to loss of&#xA;self-control, and this leads to the warping&#xA;of the mind and utter destruction.&amp;rdquo; He&#xA;illustrated his advice by the ancient tale,&#xA;which is given below.&#xA;In olden times there was a celebrated sage&#xA;named Baladhi. He had a son whose&#xA;untimely death plunged him into grief. So,&#xA;be practised rigorous penance to get a son&#xA;who would never meet with death.&#xA;The gods told the sage that this could&#xA;never be, for the human race was&#xA;necessarily mortal, and there need must be&#xA;a limit to human life. They asked him to&#xA;name his own limit.&#xA;The sage replied: &amp;ldquo;In that case grant that&#xA;the life of my son may persist as long as&#xA;that mountain lasts.&amp;rdquo; The boon was&#xA;granted to him and he was duly blessed&#xA;with a son named Medhavi.&#xA;Medhavi grew conceited at the thought&#xA;that he was safe from death forever, since&#xA;he would live as long as the mountain&#xA;existed, and he behaved with arrogance&#xA;towards all.&#xA;One day, this vain man showed disrespect&#xA;to a great sage named Dhanushaksha. At&#xA;once that sage cursed that he might be&#xA;turned to ashes, but the curse took no&#xA;effect on Medhavi who remained in&#xA;perfect health.&#xA;Seeing this, the high-souled sage was&#xA;puzzled and then remembered the gift&#xA;Medhavi had been endowed with at birth.&#xA;Dhanushaksha took the form of a wild&#xA;buffalo and by the power of his penances&#xA;butted at the mountain and broke it to&#xA;pieces and Medhavi fell down dead.&#xA;Bharadwaja concluded the story with this&#xA;solemn warning to his son: &amp;ldquo;Learn&#xA;wisdom from this old story. Be not ruined&#xA;by vanity. Cultivate self-restraint. Do not&#xA;transgress the limits of good conduct and&#xA;do not be disrespectful to the great&#xA;Raibhya.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It was springtime. The trees and creepers&#xA;were beautiful with flowers and the whole&#xA;forest was gorgeous with color and sweet&#xA;with the song of birds.&#xA;The very earth seemed to be under the&#xA;spell of the god of love. Paravasu&amp;rsquo;s wife&#xA;was strolling alone in the garden near the&#xA;hermitage of Raibhya. She appeared more&#xA;than human, in the sweet union in her of&#xA;beauty, courage and purity.&#xA;At that time Yavakrida came there and&#xA;was so overwhelmed by her loveliness&#xA;that he completely lost his sense and self-&#xA;control and became as a ravening beast&#xA;with lust.&#xA;He accosted her and taking brutal&#xA;advantage of her fear and shame and&#xA;bewilderment, he dragged her to a lonely&#xA;pot and violated her person.Raibhya returned to his hermitage. He saw&#xA;his daughter in-law weeping, broken-&#xA;hearted and inconsolable and learning of&#xA;the shameful outrage perpetrated on her,&#xA;he was seized with implacable anger. He&#xA;plucked a hair from his bead and offered it&#xA;to the fire reciting a mantra.&#xA;At once, a maiden, as beautiful as his&#xA;daughter-in-law,&#xA;emerged&#xA;from&#xA;the&#xA;sacrificial fire.&#xA;The sage plucked another hair from his&#xA;knotted lock and offered it as oblation. A&#xA;terrible ghost rose from the fire. The sage&#xA;commanded them to kill Yavakrida. Both&#xA;of them bowed to the order.&#xA;While Yavakrida was performing the&#xA;morning rites, the female spirit went near&#xA;him and with smiles and allurements put&#xA;him off his guard and as she ran away&#xA;with his water-jug, the male ghost rushed&#xA;on him with uplifted spear.&#xA;Yavakrida stood up in fear. Knowing that&#xA;his mantras would be of no avail until he&#xA;cleansed himself with water, he looked for&#xA;his water-jug. When he found it missing,&#xA;he rushed to a pond for water but the pond&#xA;was dry. He went to nearby stream, which&#xA;also dried up at his approach.&#xA;There was no water for him anywhere.&#xA;The&#xA;terrible&#xA;fiend&#xA;pursued&#xA;him&#xA;everywhere and Yavakrida fled for his&#xA;life, with the demon hot on his heels. His&#xA;sin had consumed the power of his vigils&#xA;and fasts. At last, he sought refuge in the&#xA;sacrificial hall of his father.&#xA;The half-blind man who was guarding the&#xA;hermitage stopped him as be could not&#xA;recognise Yavakrida as, distorted with&#xA;mortal fear, he sought to force his way in.&#xA;Meanwhile, the fiend overtook him and&#xA;killed him with his spear.&#xA;When Bharadvaja returned to his&#xA;hermitage, he came upon his son&amp;rsquo;s corpse&#xA;and concluded that disrespect to Raibhya&#xA;must have led to this cruel fate.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Alas! My child, you died of your pride&#xA;and vanity. Was it not a great mistake that&#xA;you tried to learn the Vedas in a way not&#xA;resorted to by any brahmana? Why did&#xA;you behave so as to be cursed thus? May&#xA;Raibhya, who caused the death of my only&#xA;son, be himself killed by one of his sons!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus, carried away by rage and grief the&#xA;sage cursed Raibhya.&#xA;Regaining control soon, he exclaimed in&#xA;anguish: &amp;ldquo;Alas! They alone are blessed&#xA;who have no sons. I have not only lost my&#xA;only son, but in the madness of my grief I&#xA;have also cursed my friend and&#xA;companion. What is the use of continuing&#xA;my life?&amp;rdquo; He cremated his son&amp;rsquo;s body and&#xA;died by throwing himself on the funeral&#xA;pyre.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;KING Brihadyumna, a disciple of the sage&#xA;Raibhya, performed a great sacrifice at&#xA;which he requested his teacher to let his&#xA;two sons Paravasu and Arvavasu officiate.&#xA;With the permission of their father, both&#xA;of them went joyfully to the capital of the&#xA;king.&#xA;While arrangements were being made for&#xA;the sacrifice, Paravasu desired one day to&#xA;go and see his wife and, walking alone all&#xA;night, he reached his hermitage before&#xA;dawn. Near the hermitage, he saw in the&#xA;twilight, what seemed to him a beast of&#xA;prey crouching for a spring and, hurling&#xA;his weapon at it, killed it.&#xA;But to his horror and grief, he discovered&#xA;that he had killed his own father clad in&#xA;skins, mistaking him for a wild denizen of&#xA;the forest. He realised that the fatal&#xA;mistake was the effect of the curse of&#xA;Bharadwaja.&#xA;When he had hastily performed the&#xA;funeral rites of his father, he went to&#xA;Arvavasu and told him the doleful tale. He&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;But this mishap should not interfere&#xA;with the sacrifice of the king. Please dothe rites on my behalf in expiation of the&#xA;sin I have unwittingly committed. There&#xA;is,&#xA;mercifully,&#xA;atonement&#xA;for&#xA;sins&#xA;committed in ignorance. If you can be my&#xA;substitute here for undergoing the&#xA;expiation I shall be able to go and assist in&#xA;conducting the king&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice. I can&#xA;officiate unaided, which is a thing you&#xA;cannot do as yet.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The virtuous brother agreed and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You may attend to the king&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice. I&#xA;shall do penance to free you from the&#xA;terrible taint of having killed a father and&#xA;a brahmana.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The virtuous Arvavasu, accordingly, took&#xA;upon himself the expiatory rites on behalf&#xA;of his brother. That done, he came to the&#xA;court of the king to join his brother and&#xA;assist in the sacrifice.&#xA;The sin of Paravasu was not washed off,&#xA;since expiation cannot be by proxy. It&#xA;tainted his mind with wicked designs.&#xA;Becoming jealous of the radiance on his&#xA;brother&amp;rsquo;s face, Paravasu decided to&#xA;dishonor him by casting on him an&#xA;unjustice as a person and accordingly,&#xA;when Arvavasu entered the hall, Paravasu&#xA;loudly exclaimed so that the king might&#xA;hear:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This man has committed the sin of&#xA;killing a brahmana and how can he enter&#xA;this holy sacrificial place?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arvavasu&#xA;indignantly&#xA;denied&#xA;the&#xA;accusation but none heeded him, and he&#xA;was ignominiously expelled from that hall&#xA;of sacrifice by the orders of the king.&#xA;Arvavasu&#xA;repeatedly&#xA;protested&#xA;his&#xA;innocence. &amp;ldquo;It is my brother who has&#xA;committed the sin and even then it was&#xA;through a mistake. I have saved him by&#xA;performing expiatory rites.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This made matters worse for him for&#xA;nobody believed that the expiation he had&#xA;undergone was not for his own crime and&#xA;everyone thought that he was adding false&#xA;accusation against a blameless brother, to&#xA;his other sins.&#xA;The virtuous Arvavasu who, besides being&#xA;falsely accused of a monstrous crime, was&#xA;also slandered as a liar, retreated to the&#xA;forest in despair of finding justice in the&#xA;world and betook himself to rigorous&#xA;austerities.&#xA;The gods were gracious and asked him:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O virtuous soul, what is the boon you&#xA;seek?&amp;rdquo; High thinking and deep meditation&#xA;had in the meantime cleansed his heart of&#xA;all anger at his brother&amp;rsquo;s conduct; and so,&#xA;he only prayed that his father might be&#xA;restored to life and that his brother might&#xA;be freed from wickedness and the sins that&#xA;he had committed.&#xA;The gods granted his prayer.&#xA;Lomasa&#xA;narrated&#xA;this&#xA;story&#xA;to&#xA;Yudhishthira at a place near Raibhya&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;hermitage and said: &amp;ldquo;O Pandavas, bathe&#xA;here and wash off your passions in this&#xA;holy river.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arvavasu and Paravasu were both sons of&#xA;a great scholar. Both of them learnt at his&#xA;feet and became eminent scholars&#xA;themselves.&#xA;But learning is one thing and virtue is&#xA;quite another. It is true that one should&#xA;know the difference between good and&#xA;evil, if one is to seek good and shun evil.&#xA;But this knowledge should soak into every&#xA;thought and influence every act in one&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;life.&#xA;Then indeed knowledge becomes virtue.&#xA;The knowledge that is merely so much&#xA;undigested information crammed into the&#xA;mind, cannot instill virtue.&#xA;It is just an outward show like our clothes&#xA;and is no real part of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHILE the Pandavas were wandering&#xA;among holy places in the forest, they&#xA;came one day to the hermitage of the&#xA;personages&#xA;immortalized&#xA;in&#xA;theUpanishads. Lomasa told Yudhishthira the&#xA;story of that place.&#xA;Udalaka, a great sage and teacher of&#xA;Vedanta, had a disciple named Kagola,&#xA;who was virtuous and devoted but had no&#xA;great learning. So, the other disciples used&#xA;to laugh and mock at him.&#xA;Uddalaka, however, attached no great&#xA;weight to his disciple&amp;rsquo;s lack of erudition&#xA;but really appreciated his virtues, devotion&#xA;and good conduct and gave his daughter&#xA;Sujata in marriage to him.&#xA;The couple was blessed with a son. A&#xA;child generally inherits the characteristics&#xA;of both the parents. But fortunately the&#xA;grandson of Uddalaka took after his&#xA;grandfather rather than his father and&#xA;knew the Vedas even while he was in his&#xA;mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&#xA;When Kagola made mistakes, as he often&#xA;did in reciting the Vedas, the child in the&#xA;womb would twist his body with pain, and&#xA;so it came to pass that he had eight&#xA;crooked bends in his body when he was&#xA;born.&#xA;These crooked bends earned him the name&#xA;of Ashtavakra, which means &amp;ldquo;Eight&#xA;crooked bends.&amp;rdquo; Kagola, one ill-fated day,&#xA;provoked a polemical contest with Vandi,&#xA;the court scholar of Mithila, and, having&#xA;been defeated, was made to drown&#xA;himself.&#xA;Meanwhile Ashtavakra grew up to be a&#xA;towering scholar even in his boyhood, and&#xA;at the age of twelve he had already&#xA;completed his study of the Vedas and the&#xA;Vedanta.&#xA;One day, Ashtavakra learnt that Janaka,&#xA;the king of Mithila was performing a great&#xA;sacrifice in the course of which the&#xA;assembled scholars would, as usual,&#xA;debate on the sastras.&#xA;Ashtavakra&#xA;set&#xA;out&#xA;for&#xA;Mithila,&#xA;accompanied by his uncle Svetaketu. On&#xA;their way to the place of sacrifice at&#xA;Mithila, they came across the king and his&#xA;retinue.&#xA;The attendants of the king marched in&#xA;front shouting: &amp;ldquo;Move away. Make way&#xA;for the King.&amp;rdquo; Ashtavakra instead of&#xA;moving out of the way said to the&#xA;retainers:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O royal attendants, even the king, if he is&#xA;righteous, has to move and make way for&#xA;the blind, the deformed, the fair sex,&#xA;persons bearing loads and brahmanas&#xA;learned in the Vedas. This is the rule&#xA;enjoined by the scriptures.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The king, surprised at these wise words of&#xA;the brahmana boy, accepted the justness&#xA;of the rebuke and made way, observing to&#xA;his attendants: &amp;ldquo;What this brahmana&#xA;stripling says is true. Fire is fire whether it&#xA;is tiny or big and it has the power to&#xA;burn.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ashtavakra and Svetaketu entered the&#xA;sacrificial hall. The gatekeeper stopped&#xA;them and said: &amp;ldquo;Boys cannot go in. Only&#xA;old men learned in the Vedas may go into&#xA;the sacrificial hall.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ashtavakra replied: &amp;ldquo;We are not mere&#xA;boys. We have observed the necessary&#xA;vows and have learnt the Vedas. Those&#xA;who have mastered the truths of the&#xA;Vedanta will not judge another on mere&#xA;considerations of age or appearance.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The gatekeeper said: &amp;ldquo;Stop. Have done&#xA;with your idle brag. How can you, a mere&#xA;boy, have learnt and realised the&#xA;Vedanta?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The boy said: &amp;ldquo;You mean I am not big like&#xA;an over-grown gourd with no substance in&#xA;it? Size is no indication of knowledge or&#xA;worth, nor is age. A very tall old man may&#xA;be a tall old fool. Let me pass.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The gatekeeper said: &amp;ldquo;You are certainly&#xA;not old, nor tall, though you talk like all&#xA;the hoary sages. Get out.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ashtavakra replied: &amp;ldquo;Gatekeeper, Grey&#xA;hairs do not prove the ripeness of the soul.&#xA;The really mature man is the one who haslearnt the Vedas and the Vedangas,&#xA;mastered their gist and realised their&#xA;essence. I am here to meet the court pandit&#xA;Vandi. Inform King Janaka of my desire.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At that moment the king himself came&#xA;there and easily recognized Ashtavakra,&#xA;the precociously wise boy he had met&#xA;before.&#xA;The king asked: &amp;ldquo;Do you know that my&#xA;court pandit Vandi has overthrown in&#xA;argument many great scholars in the past&#xA;and caused them to be cast into the ocean?&#xA;Does that not deter you from this&#xA;dangerous adventure?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ashtavakra&#xA;replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Your&#xA;eminent&#xA;scholar has not hitherto encountered men&#xA;like me who are proficient in the Vedas on&#xA;Vedanta. He has become arrogant and&#xA;vain with easy victories over good men&#xA;who were not real scholars. I have come&#xA;here to repay the debt due on account of&#xA;my father, who was defeated by this man&#xA;and made to drown himself, as I have&#xA;heard from my mother. I have no doubt I&#xA;shall vanquish Vandi, whom you will see&#xA;crumple up like a broken-wheeled cart.&#xA;Please summon him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ashtavakra met Vandi. They took up a&#xA;debatable thesis and started an argument,&#xA;each employing his utmost learning and&#xA;wits to confound the other. And in the end&#xA;the assembly unanimously declared the&#xA;victory of Ashtavakra and the defeat of&#xA;Vandi.&#xA;The court pandit of Mithila bowed his&#xA;head and paid the forfeit by drowning&#xA;himself in the ocean and going to the&#xA;abode of Varuna.Then the spirit of&#xA;Kagola, the father of Ashtavakra, gained&#xA;peace and joy in the glory of his son.&#xA;The author of the epic instructs us through&#xA;these words put in Kagola&amp;rsquo;s mouth: &amp;ldquo;A&#xA;son need not be like his father. A father&#xA;who is physically weak may have a very&#xA;strong son and an ignorant father may&#xA;have a scholarly son. It is wrong to&#xA;acesess the greatness of a man on his&#xA;physical appearance or age. External&#xA;appearances are deceptive.&amp;rdquo; Which shows&#xA;that the unlearned Kagola was not devoid&#xA;of common sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DRAUPADI used to complain frequently:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This Kamyaka forest is not beautiful&#xA;without Arjuna. I find no joy in life in the&#xA;absence of Arjuna.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The other Pandavas shared Draupadi&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;wretchedness at separation from Arjuna,&#xA;who had gone to the Himalayas in quest&#xA;of divine weapons.&#xA;Bhimasena told Draupadi: &amp;ldquo;Blessed lady, I&#xA;myself feel the same about Arjuna and&#xA;what you say makes me thrill with love&#xA;and sympathy. Bereft of Arjuna, this&#xA;beautiful forest seems desolate. My mind&#xA;can know no peace without seeing Arjuna.&#xA;Sahadeva, how do you feel?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sahadeva said: &amp;ldquo;This hermitage seems to&#xA;be empty without Arjuna. We shall try&#xA;whether a change of scene will help us to&#xA;bear the pain of separation better.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;addressing&#xA;his&#xA;priest&#xA;Dhaumya said: &amp;ldquo;I have sent my younger&#xA;brother Arjuna to win divine weapons.&#xA;That dauntless and dexterous hero has not&#xA;yet returned. We have sent him to the&#xA;Himalayas to get from Indra, the king of&#xA;gods, weapons with which we could&#xA;conquer Bhishma, Drona, Kripa and&#xA;Aswatthama, since it is certain that these&#xA;heroes will fight on the side of the sons of&#xA;Dhritarashtra. Karna knows the secret of&#xA;divine weapons, and his supreme wish is&#xA;to fight with Arjuna. I have sent Arjuna to&#xA;gain Indra&amp;rsquo;s grace and get weapons from&#xA;him as the Kaurava heroes can be defeated&#xA;by no other means. Having sent him on a&#xA;very difficult errand, we cannot live here&#xA;happily, for we miss him in all our&#xA;accustomed haunts. I wish to go&#xA;elsewhere, for that may enable us to bearthe separation better. Can you suggest&#xA;where we could go?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhaumya described many forests and holy&#xA;places. The Pandavas went the round of&#xA;those places to relieve themselves to some&#xA;extent from the pangs of separation.&#xA;They spent many years in this pilgrimage&#xA;and in listening to the traditions, which&#xA;sanctified each shrine. Draupadi would&#xA;often feel exhausted by having to traverse&#xA;mountains and forests. Bhima, sometimes&#xA;helped by his son Ghalotkacha, would&#xA;serve and encourage them and make their&#xA;labors easy.&#xA;In the course of their wanderings through&#xA;the Himalayan regions they came to a&#xA;terrible forest where the path was rugged&#xA;and steep.&#xA;Yudhishthira was worried and told Bhima&#xA;that the way would greatly distress&#xA;Draupadi but that he himself would go on&#xA;accompanied by Nakula and the sage&#xA;Lomasa.&#xA;He suggested that Bhima and Sahadeva&#xA;should stay behind at Gangadwara with&#xA;Draupadi. Bhima would not agree. He&#xA;said that the pain of separation from&#xA;Arjuna ought to have taught his brother&#xA;how much he would suffer if he were&#xA;parted from Sahadeva, Draupadi and&#xA;Bhima.&#xA;Besides,&#xA;Bhima&#xA;could&#xA;not&#xA;leave&#xA;Yudhishthira alone in this forest infested&#xA;with Rakshasas, demons and wild&#xA;animals. The way was hard, but he could&#xA;easily carry Draupadi across the most&#xA;difficult parts of it. He could carry Nakula&#xA;and Sahadeva also.&#xA;When&#xA;Bhima&#xA;said&#xA;these&#xA;words,&#xA;Yudhishthira embraced him and blessed&#xA;him and wished him an increase of&#xA;physical strength. Draupadi smiled and&#xA;said, addressing Yudhishthira: &amp;ldquo;No one&#xA;need carry me. I can walk. Do not be&#xA;anxious about me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They reached Kulinda, the kingdom of&#xA;Subahu, on the Himalayas. They accepted&#xA;the honors rendered to them by that king&#xA;and rested there awhile. Later on, they&#xA;went to the charming forest of&#xA;Narayanasrama and halted there.&#xA;One day, a breeze that blew from the&#xA;northeast wafted a beautiful flower near&#xA;Draupadi. Draupadi took it in her hands&#xA;and was so charmed with its fragrance and&#xA;beauty that she showed it rapturously to&#xA;Bhima.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Come and see this flower. What a sweet&#xA;fragrance! How charming! I shall hand&#xA;this over to Yudhishthira. Bring some&#xA;flowers of this kind. We should grow this&#xA;plant in our Kamyaka forest.&amp;rdquo; Draupadi&#xA;ran to give the flower to Yudhishthira.&#xA;Anxious to please his beloved Draupadi,&#xA;Bhima went in quest of that plant. He&#xA;went alone in the direction from which the&#xA;fragrance seemed to be borne by the&#xA;breeze, without wasting a thought on the&#xA;wild beasts that crossed his path.&#xA;He presently came to a garden of plantain&#xA;trees at the foot of a mountain, and there&#xA;he saw a huge monkey shining like&#xA;blazing fire, which lay right across his&#xA;path blocking it.&#xA;He tried to frighten the animal out of his&#xA;way by shouting at it. It only half opened&#xA;its eyes lazily and drawled: &amp;ldquo;I am&#xA;indisposed and so I am lying here. Why&#xA;lid you wake me? You are a wise human&#xA;being and I am mere animal. It is proper&#xA;that the rational man should show mercy&#xA;to animals as interior creatures. I am&#xA;afraid you are ignorant of right and&#xA;wrong. Who are you? Whither are you&#xA;bound? It is not possible to go further&#xA;along this mountain path which is the path&#xA;of the gods. Men cannot cross this limit.&#xA;Eat what you like of the fruits of this place&#xA;and if you are wise, go back in peace.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhima, unused to being taken so lightly,&#xA;grew angry and shouted: &amp;ldquo;Who are you,yourself, you monkey, that indulges in&#xA;such tall talk? I am a kshatriya hero, a&#xA;descendant of the Kuru race and a son of&#xA;Kunti. Know that I am the son of the&#xA;Wind god. Now move away from the path&#xA;or stop me at your peril.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing these words the monkey merely&#xA;smiled and said: &amp;ldquo;I am, as you say, a&#xA;monkey, but you will come to destruction&#xA;if you try to force a way.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhima said: &amp;ldquo;I do not want your advice&#xA;and it is no concern of yours if I go to&#xA;destruction. Get up and move out of the&#xA;way or I will make you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The monkey replied: &amp;ldquo;I have no strength&#xA;to stand up, being but a very old monkey.&#xA;If you have to go at any cost, jump over&#xA;me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhima said: &amp;ldquo;Nothing could be easier but&#xA;the scriptures forbid it. Otherwise I should&#xA;jump over you and the mountain in one&#xA;bound, like Hanuman crossing the ocean.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The monkey remarked as though in&#xA;surprise: &amp;ldquo;O best of men, who is that&#xA;Hanuman who crossed the ocean? If you&#xA;know his story, enlighten me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhima roared and said: &amp;ldquo;Have you not&#xA;heard of Hanuman, my elder brother, who&#xA;crossed the ocean, a hundred yojanas in&#xA;breadth, to seek and find Sita, the wife of&#xA;Rama? I am equal to him in strength and&#xA;heroism. Well, that is enough talk, now&#xA;get up and make way and do not provoke&#xA;me to do you some harm.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The monkey answered: &amp;ldquo;O mighty hero,&#xA;be patient. Be gentle as you are strong,&#xA;and have mercy on the old and weak. I&#xA;have no strength to rise up as I am&#xA;decrepit with age. Since you have scruples&#xA;in jumping over me, kindly move aside&#xA;my tail and make a path for yourself.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Proud of his immense strength, Bhima&#xA;thought to pull the monkey out of the way&#xA;by its tail. But, to his amazement he could&#xA;not move it in the least, though he exerted&#xA;all his strength.&#xA;He set his jaws and strained every muscle&#xA;till the very sinews cracked and he was&#xA;covered with perspiration. But, still, could&#xA;not move that tail the least, a little bit up&#xA;or down or sideways. In shame, he bent&#xA;down his head, and then asked in a&#xA;chastened mood:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Who are you? Forgive me and reveal to&#xA;me whether you are a Siddha, god or&#xA;Gandharva.&amp;rdquo; Bhima like most strong men,&#xA;was all respect when he saw one stronger&#xA;than himself, and spoke like a pupil&#xA;addressing his master.&#xA;Hanuman replied: &amp;ldquo;O mighty-armed&#xA;Pandava, know that I am your brother,&#xA;even that Hanuman, the son of the Wind&#xA;god, whom you mentioned a little while&#xA;ago. If you go on this path, which is the&#xA;road to the spirit-world where the Yakshas&#xA;and the Rakshasas abide, you will meet&#xA;with danger and that is why I stop you. No&#xA;man can go beyond this and live. But here&#xA;is the stream with its depths where you&#xA;can find the Saugandhika plant you came&#xA;to seek.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhima was transported with delight: &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;count myself the most fortunate of men in&#xA;that I have been blessed to meet my&#xA;brother. I wish to see the form in which&#xA;you crossed the ocean,&amp;rdquo; and he prostrated&#xA;before Hanuman.&#xA;Hanuman smiled and began to increase&#xA;the size of his body and stood forth firmly&#xA;to the world like a mountain seeming to&#xA;fill the landscape.&#xA;Bhima was thrilled at actually seeing that&#xA;divine form of this elder brother, the mere&#xA;description of which had till then filled&#xA;him with wonder. He covered his eyes,&#xA;unable to bear the dazzling light radiating&#xA;from that figure.&#xA;Hanuman said: &amp;ldquo;Bhima, in the presence of&#xA;my enemies, my body can grow still&#xA;more.&amp;rdquo; And Hanuman contracted his&#xA;body, resuming his former size. He&#xA;tenderly embraced Bhimasena.Bhagavan Vyasa says that Bhima felt&#xA;completely refreshed and became much&#xA;stronger than before by the embrace of&#xA;Hanuman.&#xA;Hanuman said: &amp;ldquo;O hero, go to your abode.&#xA;Think of me whenever you are in need. I&#xA;felt the same delight when I embraced you&#xA;that I had in times of yore when I was&#xA;fortunate enough to touch the divine body&#xA;of Sri Rama. Ask any boon that you like.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhima said: &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the Pandavas for&#xA;I have had the good fortune to see you.&#xA;Inspired with your strength we are sure to&#xA;conquer our enemies.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman gave this parting blessing to his&#xA;brother:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;While you roar like a lion in the&#xA;battlefield, my voice shall join yours and&#xA;strike terror into the hearts of your&#xA;enemies. I shall be present on the flag of&#xA;the chariot of your brother Arjuna. You&#xA;will be victorious.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman pointed out to Bhima the stream&#xA;nearby, where grew the Saugandhika&#xA;flowers he had come to seek.&#xA;This put Bhima at once in mind of&#xA;Draupadi who was waiting for his return,&#xA;and he collected the flowers and returned&#xA;to her without delay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ONCE the sage Markandeya came to see&#xA;the Pandavas. Yudhishthira happened to&#xA;talk of the virtues of the fair sex and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What greater wonder is there in this&#xA;world than the patience and the chastity of&#xA;woman? She gives birth to a child after&#xA;cherishing it in her womb as dearer than&#xA;life itself. She brings it into the world&#xA;inpain and anxiety and thence forward her&#xA;one thought is for its health and&#xA;happiness. Large hearted and forgiving, a&#xA;woman forgives and continues to love&#xA;even a wicked husband who neglects and&#xA;hates and subjects her to all sorts of&#xA;miseries. How strange!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing this Markandeya told him a&#xA;sacred story.&#xA;There was once a brahmana, named&#xA;Kausika who observed his vow of&#xA;brahmacharya. with great steadfastness&#xA;and devotion.&#xA;One day, he sat under a tree reciting the&#xA;Vedas. A crane, perched on the top of the&#xA;tree, defiled his head with its droppings.&#xA;He looked up at it, and his angry look&#xA;killed the bird and it fell down dead.&#xA;The brahmana was pained when he saw&#xA;the dead bird lying on the ground.&#xA;How frightful it would be if wishes&#xA;fulfilled themselves, if each hasty or angry&#xA;wish took effect at once! How much there&#xA;would be to regret or repent afterwards! It&#xA;is lucky for us that wishes depend&#xA;onoutward&#xA;circumstances&#xA;for&#xA;accomplishment, since that saves us from&#xA;much sin and sorrow.&#xA;Kausika sorrowed that the evil thought&#xA;that passed in his mind in a moment of&#xA;anger had killed an innocent bird. Some&#xA;time later, he went as usual to beg alms.&#xA;He stood before the door of a house to&#xA;receive his dole. The housewife was&#xA;cleansing utensils at that time. Kausika&#xA;waited in the hope that she would attend&#xA;to him after her work was over.&#xA;In the meantime the master of the house&#xA;returned, tired and hungry, and the wife&#xA;had to attend to his wants, wash and dry&#xA;his feet and serve him with food.&#xA;In this preoccupation she seemed to have&#xA;forgotten the mendicant waiting outside.&#xA;After her husband had been cared for and&#xA;fed, she came out with alms to the&#xA;mendicant.&#xA;She said: &amp;ldquo;I am sorry to have kept you&#xA;waiting long. Pardon me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kausika, burning with anger, said: &amp;ldquo;Lady,&#xA;you have made me wait for such a long&#xA;time. This indifference is not fair.&amp;ldquo;The woman told the brahmana: &amp;ldquo;Best of&#xA;brahmanas, kindly do forgive me. I was&#xA;serving my husband and hence the delay.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The brahmana remarked: &amp;ldquo;It is right and&#xA;proper to attend on the husband, but the&#xA;brahmana also should not be disregarded.&#xA;You seem an arrogant woman.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She said: &amp;ldquo;Be not angry with me and&#xA;remember that I kept you waiting only&#xA;because I was dutifully serving my&#xA;husband. I am no crane to be killed by a&#xA;violent thought and your rage can do no&#xA;harm to the woman who devotes herself to&#xA;the service of her husband.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The brahmana was taken aback. He&#xA;wondered how the woman knew of the&#xA;crane incident.&#xA;She continued: &amp;ldquo;O great one, you do not&#xA;know the secret of duty, and you are also&#xA;not aware that anger is the greatest enemy&#xA;that dwells in man. Forgive the delay in&#xA;attending to you. Go to Mithila and be&#xA;instructed in the secret of good life by&#xA;Dharmavyadha living in that city.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The brahmana was amazed. He said: &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;deserve your just admonition and it will&#xA;do me good. May all good attend you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With these words he went to Mithila.&#xA;Kausika reached Mithila and looked for&#xA;Dharmavyadha&amp;rsquo;s residence, which he&#xA;thought would be some lonely hermitage&#xA;far from the noise and bustle of common&#xA;life.&#xA;He walked along magnificent roads&#xA;between beautiful houses and gardens in&#xA;that great city and finally reached a&#xA;butcher&amp;rsquo;s shop, in which was a man selling&#xA;meat. His amazement was great when he&#xA;learnt that this man was Dharmavyadha.&#xA;The brahmana was shocked beyond&#xA;measure and stood at a distance in disgust.&#xA;The butcher suddenly rose from his seat,&#xA;came to the brahmana and inquired:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Revered sir, are you well? Did that&#xA;chaste brahmana lady send you to me?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The brahmana was stupefied.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Revered sir, I know why you have come.&#xA;Let us go home,&amp;rdquo; said the butcher and he&#xA;took the brahmana to his house where he&#xA;saw a happy family and was greatly struck&#xA;by the devotion with which the butcher&#xA;served his parents.&#xA;Kausika took his lessons from that butcher&#xA;on dharma, man&amp;rsquo;s calling and duty.&#xA;Afterwards, the brahmana returned to his&#xA;house and began to tend his parents, a&#xA;duty, which he had rather neglected&#xA;before.&#xA;The moral of this striking story of&#xA;Dharmavyadha so skillfully woven by&#xA;Vedavyasa into the Mahabharata, is the&#xA;same as the teaching of the Gita. Man&#xA;reaches perfection by the honest pursuit of&#xA;whatever calling falls to his lot in life, and&#xA;that this is really worship of God who&#xA;created and pervades all. (Bhagavad Gita,&#xA;XVIII, 45-46)&#xA;The occupation may be one he is born to&#xA;in society or it may have been forced on&#xA;him by circumstances or be may have&#xA;taken it up by choice. But what really&#xA;matters is the spirit of sincerity and&#xA;faithfulness with which be does his life&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;work.&#xA;Vedavyasa emphasizes this great truth by&#xA;making a scholarly brahmana, who did not&#xA;know it, learn it from a butcher, who lived&#xA;it in his humble and despised life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MANY brahmanas visited the Pandavas&#xA;during their exile. And one such, returning&#xA;to Hastinapura, went to see Dhritarashtra,&#xA;who received him with due honor.&#xA;The brahmana told him how the Pandavas,&#xA;born princes, were, by unkind destiny, at&#xA;the mercy of the wind and the sun and&#xA;suffered great privations.&#xA;Dhritarashtra was probably sorry to hear&#xA;this. But what troubled him most were the&#xA;consequences to his own sons. CouldYudhishthira continue to hold the justly&#xA;wrathful Bhima in check?&#xA;Dhritarashtra feared that the anger of the&#xA;Pandavas, long pent up, might one day&#xA;break its bounds and overflow in a&#xA;devastating flood.&#xA;The king anxiously pondered thus:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Arjuna and Bhima will certainly try to&#xA;punish us. Sakuni, Karna, Duryodhana&#xA;and the short-sighted Duhsasana are&#xA;perched precariously up a tree in search of&#xA;a honeycomb while below is the abyss of&#xA;Bhima&amp;rsquo;s anger yawning to receive them to&#xA;their destruction.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The blind king pursued his thought: &amp;ldquo;Alas,&#xA;why did we become a prey to&#xA;covetousness? It is not as though poverty&#xA;drove us to it! Why did we take to the&#xA;path of injustice? Instead of enjoying our&#xA;boundless wealth in contentment we&#xA;succumbed to lust of power and&#xA;possession and coveted what was not ours.&#xA;Wrong cannot but yield its bitter harvest!&#xA;Arjuna has returned from heaven with&#xA;divine weapons. What could tempt one&#xA;back to earth from heaven but the craving&#xA;for vengeance? And we have earned it!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;These thoughts would haunt and give him&#xA;no peace.&#xA;Though Dhritarashtra was thus worried,&#xA;Sakuni, Karna and Duryodhana were&#xA;giddily happy and found much pleasure in&#xA;exulting congratulation of one another on&#xA;their prosperity.&#xA;Karna and Sakuni said to Duryodhana:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The kingdom which was in the hands of&#xA;Yudhishthira has become ours. We need&#xA;no longer burn with jealousy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana replied: &amp;ldquo;O Karna, all that is&#xA;true, but would it not be a joy of joys to&#xA;see with my own eyes the sufferings of&#xA;the Pandavas and bring their sorrow to a&#xA;climax by a display of our happiness? The&#xA;only way to perfect our happiness is to go&#xA;to the forest and see the distress of the&#xA;Pandavas, but my father will refuse&#xA;permission,&amp;rdquo; and Duryodhana shed tears&#xA;at his father&amp;rsquo;s cruelty in denying him this&#xA;pleasure.&#xA;He said again: &amp;ldquo;The king fears the&#xA;Pandavas, as he thinks that they are&#xA;endowed with the power of austerities. He&#xA;forbids us to go to the forest and meet&#xA;them, lest danger should befall us. But I&#xA;tell you, all we have done so far is labor&#xA;lost, without a sight of the sufferings of&#xA;Draupadi, Bhima and Arjuna in the forest.&#xA;This life of idle ease is torment to me&#xA;without that great joy. Sakuni and yourself&#xA;must seek a way of obtaining the king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;consent for us to go to the forest and see&#xA;the Pandavas in their misery.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Early next morning, Karna went to&#xA;Duryodhana with a cheerful face and&#xA;announced that he had found a way out of&#xA;the difficulty.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;What do you think of going to&#xA;our ranches at Dwaitavana for the annual&#xA;stock-taking of the cows? The king&#xA;certainly cannot object to that.&amp;rdquo; Sakuni&#xA;and Duryodhana applauded this bright&#xA;idea and sent the leader of the cowherds to&#xA;the king to secure his permission.&#xA;But the king would not assent. He said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Hunting is indeed beneficial to the&#xA;princes. It is also desirable to take stock of&#xA;the cows. But I learn that the Pandavas are&#xA;dwelling in that forest. It is not advisable&#xA;for you to go there. I cannot agree to send&#xA;you to a place near the abode of Bhima&#xA;and Arjuna while there is still occasion for&#xA;anger and strife.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana said: &amp;ldquo;We shall not go near&#xA;them. On the contrary we shall be very&#xA;careful and avoid them.&amp;rdquo; The king&#xA;answered:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;However careful you may be, there is&#xA;danger in mere nearness. Also, it is not&#xA;right to intrude on the sorrows of the&#xA;Pandavas in their forest life. Anyone of&#xA;your soldiers might trespass and give&#xA;offence, which may lead to trouble.Someone else can go in your stead to&#xA;count the cattle.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sakuni said: &amp;ldquo;O king, Yudhishthira knows&#xA;and follows the path of dharma. He has&#xA;given his promise in the open assembly&#xA;and the Pandavas will follow his bidding.&#xA;The sons of Kunti will not show any&#xA;enmity towards us. Do not oppose&#xA;Duryodhana who is fond of hunting. Let&#xA;him return after taking stock of the cows. I&#xA;shall also accompany him and see to it&#xA;that none of us go anywhere near the&#xA;Pandavas.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The king, over-persuaded as usual, said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Well, please yourselves.&amp;rdquo; A heart full of&#xA;hate can know no contentment. Hate is a&#xA;cruel fire, which extorts the fuel, on which&#xA;it lives and grows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE Kauravas reached Dwaitavana with a&#xA;great&#xA;army&#xA;and&#xA;many&#xA;followers.&#xA;Duryodhana and Karna went with&#xA;unconcealed joy at the very thought of&#xA;being able to gloat on the sad plight of the&#xA;Pandavas.&#xA;They themselves camped in luxurious rest&#xA;houses in a place four miles off the abode&#xA;of the Pandavas. They inspected the herds&#xA;of cows and took stock of them.&#xA;After counting the cows, bulls and calves,&#xA;they enjoyed the dance, the hunt, the&#xA;sylvan sports and other entertainment’s&#xA;arranged for them.&#xA;While hunting, Duryodhana and his party&#xA;reached an attractive pond near the&#xA;hermitage of the Pandavas and ordered a&#xA;camp to be put on its bank.&#xA;Chitrasena, the king of the Gandharvas,&#xA;and his attendants had already encamped&#xA;in the neighborhood of the pool and they&#xA;prevented Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s men from putting&#xA;up their camp.&#xA;They returned to Duryodhana and&#xA;represented that some petty prince who&#xA;was there with his followers was giving&#xA;them trouble.&#xA;Duryodhana was annoyed at this&#xA;presumption and directed his men to turn&#xA;the Gandharva prince out and put up the&#xA;tents. The attendants returned to the lake&#xA;and tried to carry out their orders but&#xA;found the Gandharvas too many for them&#xA;and had to retreat in precipitation.&#xA;When Duryodhana came to know of this,&#xA;he grew very angry and with a large army&#xA;marched to destroy the audacious enemies&#xA;who had dared to resist his pleasure. A&#xA;great&#xA;fight&#xA;ensued&#xA;between&#xA;the&#xA;Gandharvas and Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s army.&#xA;At first the fight went in favor of the&#xA;Kauravas. But the tables were quickly&#xA;turned when Chitrasena, the king of the&#xA;Gandharvas, rallied his troops and began&#xA;using his magic weapons.&#xA;Karna and the other Kaurava heroes lost&#xA;their chariots and weapons and had to&#xA;retreat&#xA;in&#xA;haste&#xA;and&#xA;ignominy.&#xA;Duryodhana alone remained in the&#xA;battlefield but he was soon seized by&#xA;Chitrasena, who placed him in his chariot&#xA;bound hand and foot, and blew his conch&#xA;in token of victory.&#xA;The Gandharvas took many of the&#xA;prominent Kauravas captive. The Kaurava&#xA;army fled in all directions and some of the&#xA;fugitives took refuge in the hermitage of&#xA;the Pandavas.&#xA;Bhima heard the news of Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;defeat and capture with delight and&#xA;amusement. He said to Yudhishthira:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;These Gandharvas have done our job for&#xA;us. Duryodhana, who must have come&#xA;here to mock at us, has got what he&#xA;deserved. I feel like thanking our&#xA;Gandharva friend!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Yudhishthira reproved him: &amp;ldquo;Dear&#xA;brother, this is not the time for you to&#xA;rejoice. The Kauravas are our kith and kin&#xA;and their humiliation, at the hands of&#xA;strangers, is ours. We cannot hold back&#xA;and take this lying down. We must rescue&#xA;them.&amp;ldquo;Bhima did not think this very reasonable.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;Why should we save this sinner&#xA;who tried to burn us alive in the wax&#xA;house? Why should you feel sorry for the&#xA;fellow who poisoned my food, bound me&#xA;hand and foot and wanted to drown me in&#xA;the river? What brotherly feeling can we&#xA;really have towards these vile wretches&#xA;who hauled Draupadi by the hair to&#xA;theassembly and disgraced her?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At that moment a cry of agony from&#xA;Duryodhana reached them faintly from the&#xA;distance and Yudhishthira, greatly moved,&#xA;overruled Bhima&amp;rsquo;s objection and bade his&#xA;brothers go to the rescue of the Kauravas.&#xA;Obedient to his behest, Bhima and Arjuna&#xA;rallied the routed Kaurava forces and&#xA;offered battle to the Gandharvas. But&#xA;Chitrasena had no wish to fight with the&#xA;Pandavas and at their approach, released&#xA;Duryodhana and the other prisoners&#xA;saying that all he wanted was to teach a&#xA;lesson to these arrogant Kauravas.&#xA;The dishonored Kauravas returned in&#xA;haste to Hastinapura, with Karna, who,&#xA;having been, driven off the battlefield,&#xA;joined them on the way.&#xA;Duryodhana, in great shame and&#xA;dejection, felt it would have been far&#xA;better if be had been killed by Chitrasena&#xA;and announced his wish to fast unto death.&#xA;He said to Duhsasana: &amp;ldquo;Be crowned and&#xA;rule the kingdom. I can no longer continue&#xA;to live after having become a laughing&#xA;stock to my enemies.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duhsasana protested his unworthiness to&#xA;be king and caught hold of his brother&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;feet and wept. Karna could not bear the&#xA;sight of the brother&amp;rsquo;s sorrow.&#xA;Karna said: &amp;ldquo;This does not befit heroes of&#xA;the Kuru race. What is the use of just&#xA;collapsing under sorrow? It will but make&#xA;your enemies happy. Look at the&#xA;Pandavas. They have not taken to fasts in&#xA;spite of the disgrace they have suffered.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sakuni interposed and said: &amp;ldquo;Listen to&#xA;Karna&amp;rsquo;s words. Why do you say that you&#xA;would give up your life when the kingdom&#xA;seized from the Pandavas is yours to&#xA;enjoy? Fasting serves no purpose, for if&#xA;you really repent of what you have done&#xA;till now, you should make friends with the&#xA;Pandavas and give them back their&#xA;kingdom.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Duryodhana heard this speech, his&#xA;evil nature regained ascendancy, for&#xA;giving back the kingdom to the Pandavas&#xA;was to him a hundred times worse than&#xA;defeat or disgrace. He shouted: &amp;ldquo;I shall&#xA;conquer the Pandavas.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Karna said: &amp;ldquo;That is the way for a king to&#xA;talk.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And he added: &amp;ldquo;What sense is there in&#xA;dying? You can do something worthwhile&#xA;only if you are alive.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;While returning home, Karna said: &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;swear to you by all that is holy that, when&#xA;the stipulated period of thirteen years is&#xA;over, I will kill Arjuna in battle.&amp;rdquo; And&#xA;then he touched his sword in token of the&#xA;oath.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHILE the Pandavas were dwelling in&#xA;the forest, Duryodhana celebrated a great&#xA;sacrifice with much pomp and splendor.&#xA;He wanted to perform the Rajasuya&#xA;sacrifice, but the brahmanas told him that&#xA;he could not do that while Yudhishthira&#xA;and Dhritarashtra were alive and advised&#xA;him to perform the sacrifice known as the&#xA;Vaishnava instead.&#xA;He accepted this advice and celebrated the&#xA;Vaishnava with great splendor. But when&#xA;the ceremony was over, the citizens began&#xA;to&#xA;talk&#xA;among&#xA;themselves&#xA;that&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice had not come up to&#xA;even a sixteenth part of Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;Rajasuya in magnificence.&#xA;The friends of Duryodhana, on the other&#xA;hand, praised him and the sacrifice he had&#xA;celebrated and likened it to thoseperformed by Yayati, Mandhata, Bharata&#xA;and others.&#xA;Court flatterers were not sparing with&#xA;their praise. Karna told Duryodhana that&#xA;his Rajasuya had been only postponed till&#xA;the Pandavas should be defeated and slain&#xA;in battle and repeated that his part would&#xA;be the slaying of Arjuna.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Till I have slain Arjuna,&amp;rdquo; said he, &amp;ldquo;I shall&#xA;not take meat or wine, nor will I refuse the&#xA;prayer of anyone who asks me for&#xA;anything.&amp;rdquo; Such was the solemn vow&#xA;taken by Karna in the assembly.&#xA;The sons of Dhritarashtra were delighted&#xA;to hear this vow of the great hero Karna&#xA;and shouted in joy. They felt as if the&#xA;Pandavas had been slain already.&#xA;Spies conveyed to the Pandavas in the&#xA;forest the news of the oath taken by&#xA;Karna.&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;was&#xA;greatly&#xA;concerned, for he had a great opinion of&#xA;Karna&amp;rsquo;s prowess.&#xA;Karna had been born with divine armor&#xA;and was undoubtedly a mighty hero. One&#xA;morning, just before the hour of&#xA;awakening, Yudhishthira had a dream.&#xA;Many of our dreams come either in the&#xA;beginning or at the end of our sleep. He&#xA;dreamt that the wild beasts of the forest&#xA;came and appealed to him piteously not to&#xA;destroy them altogether, but to move on to&#xA;some other forest.&#xA;Duryodhana felt sure that the Pandavas,&#xA;who themselves lived from hand to mouth&#xA;in the forest, would be unable to feed or&#xA;entertain the sage and his following, and&#xA;would incur some dreadful curse from that&#xA;too hasty visitor for their want of&#xA;hospitality. This would give him greater&#xA;joy than any benefit he could have asked&#xA;for himself when the sage offered a boon.&#xA;Durvasa went with his disciples to the&#xA;Pandavas as was desired by Duryodhana,&#xA;as the latter were resting after their&#xA;midday meal.&#xA;The brothers welcomed the sage, saluted&#xA;and honored him. Then the sage said: &amp;ldquo;We&#xA;shall be back soon. Our meals must be&#xA;ready then, for we are hungry,&amp;rdquo; and&#xA;hurried off with his disciples to the river.&#xA;As a result of the austerities of&#xA;Yudhishthira at the beginning of their stay&#xA;in the forest, the Sun god had given him&#xA;the Akshayapatra, a wonderful vessel that&#xA;held a never-failing supply of food.&#xA;In making the gift, the god had said,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Through this I shall place at your&#xA;disposal for twelve years as much food as&#xA;is required for your daily consumption.&#xA;Not till everyone has been served and&#xA;Draupadi herself has taken her share will&#xA;the vessel become empty for the day.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accordingly, the brahmanas and other&#xA;guests would be served first. Afterwards&#xA;the Pandava brothers would take their&#xA;meals. Finally, Draupadi would have her&#xA;share.&#xA;When Durvasa reached the place, all of&#xA;them, including Draupadi, had eaten their&#xA;meals and so the vessel was empty and&#xA;denuded of its power for the day.&#xA;Draupadi was greatly troubled and&#xA;perfectly at a loss to find food when the&#xA;sage and his disciples should return after&#xA;their ablutions. In the kitchen, she prayed&#xA;earnestly to Sri Krishna to come to her aid&#xA;in this hopeless predicament and deliver&#xA;her from the wrath of the sage.&#xA;At once Sri Krishna appeared before her.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I am very hungry,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;bring&#xA;without delay something to eat and we&#xA;shall speak of other things afterwards.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Here was a pretty pass. It looked as&#xA;though the ally from whom she hoped for&#xA;relief had gone over to the foe! She cried&#xA;out in great confusion: &amp;ldquo;Alas! Why do you&#xA;try me thus, O Krishna? The power of the&#xA;vessel given by the Sun is exhausted for&#xA;the day. And the sage Durvasa has come.&#xA;What shall I do? The sage and his&#xA;disciples will soon be here and as thoughthis were not enough, you have also come&#xA;at this juncture saying that you are&#xA;hungry.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sri Krishna said: &amp;ldquo;I am terribly hungry&#xA;and want food, not excuses. Fetch the&#xA;vessel and let me see for myself.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Draupadi brought it to him. A tiny bit of&#xA;cooked vegetable and a grain of rice were&#xA;sticking to the rim of the vessel.&#xA;Sri Krishna ate them with satisfaction,&#xA;accepting them as Sri Hari, the Soul of the&#xA;Universe. Draupadi was filled with shame&#xA;at her slovenliness in not having cleaned&#xA;the vessel free of all remnants. A bit had&#xA;been left which had been partaken by&#xA;Vasudeva!&#xA;Sri&#xA;Krishna&#xA;seemed&#xA;replete&#xA;with&#xA;satisfaction after eating his solitary grain&#xA;and calling Bhima, told him to go to the&#xA;river and intimate to the revered sage that&#xA;food was ready and waiting for them.&#xA;Bhimasena, greatly puzzled, but full of&#xA;faith in Sri Krishna, hastened to the river&#xA;where Durvasa and his followers were&#xA;bathing.&#xA;They were in great surprise to find that&#xA;their ravenous hunger had given place to a&#xA;pleased satiety. They had all the&#xA;comfortable cheerfulness of people who&#xA;had feasted well.&#xA;The disciples told the sage: &amp;ldquo;We have&#xA;come here after asking Yudhishthira to&#xA;prepare food for us, but we feel well-fed&#xA;and full and cannot eat anything more.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Durvasa knew what it was and he told&#xA;Bhima: &amp;ldquo;We have taken our meals. Tell&#xA;Yudhishthira to forgive us.&amp;rdquo; Then the&#xA;party went away.&#xA;The explanation is that as the whole&#xA;universe is contained in Sri Krishna, his&#xA;satisfaction with a single grain of rice&#xA;satisfied for the time the hunger of all&#xA;beings including the sage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE stipulated period of twelve years was&#xA;drawing to a close.&#xA;One day, a deer was rubbing itself against&#xA;a poor brahmana&amp;rsquo;s fire-kindling mortar&#xA;and as it turned to go, the mortar got&#xA;entangled in its horns and the affrighted&#xA;animal fled wildly with it into the forest.&#xA;In those days matches were unknown and&#xA;fire was kindled with pieces of wood by&#xA;mechanical friction.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Alas! The deer is running away with my&#xA;fire-kindler. How can I perform the fire&#xA;sacrifice?&amp;rdquo; shouted the brahmana and&#xA;rushed towards the Pandavas for help in&#xA;his extremity.&#xA;The Pandavas pursued the animal but it&#xA;was a magic deer, which sped in great&#xA;leaps and bounds, decoying the Pandavas&#xA;far into the forest and then disappeared.&#xA;Worn out by the futile chase, the&#xA;Pandavas sat in great dejection under a&#xA;banyan tree.&#xA;Nakula sighed: &amp;ldquo;We cannot render even&#xA;this trifling service to the brahmana. How&#xA;we have degenerated!&amp;rdquo; said he sadly.&#xA;Bhima said: &amp;ldquo;Quite so. When Draupadi&#xA;was dragged into the assembly, we should&#xA;have killed those wretches. Is it not&#xA;because we did not do so that we have had&#xA;to suffer all these sorrows?&amp;rdquo; and he looked&#xA;at Arjuna sadly.&#xA;Arjuna agreed. &amp;ldquo;I bore in silence the&#xA;vulgar and insulting brag of that son of the&#xA;charioteer, doing nothing. So we have&#xA;deservedly fallen into this pitiable state.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira noticed with sorrow that all&#xA;of them had lost their cheerfulness and&#xA;courage. He thought they would be more&#xA;cheerful with something to do. He was&#xA;tormented with thirst and so he said to&#xA;Nakula: &amp;ldquo;Brother, climb that tree and see&#xA;whether there is any pool or river nearby.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Nakula climbed the tree, looked around&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;At a little distance I see water&#xA;plants and cranes. There must certainly be&#xA;water there.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira sent him to fetch some to&#xA;drink.Nakula was glad when he got to the place&#xA;and saw there was a pool. He was very&#xA;thirsty himself and so thought of&#xA;quenching his thirst first before taking&#xA;water in his quiver for his brother. But no&#xA;sooner did he dip his hand in the&#xA;transparent water than he heard a voice,&#xA;which said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do not be rash. This pool belongs to me.&#xA;O son of Madri, answer my questions and&#xA;then drink the water.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Nakula was surprised, but carried away by&#xA;his intense thirst and heedless of the&#xA;warning, he drank the water. At once,&#xA;overcome by irresistible drowsiness, he&#xA;fell down, to all appearance dead.&#xA;Surprised that Nakula had not returned,&#xA;Yudhishthira sent Sahadeva to see what&#xA;the matter was. When Sahadeva reached&#xA;the pool and saw his brother lying on the&#xA;ground, he wondered whether any harm&#xA;had come to him. But before looking into&#xA;the matter further, rushed irresistibly to&#xA;the water to quench his burning thirst.&#xA;The voice was heard again: &amp;ldquo;O Sahadeva,&#xA;this is my pool. Answer my questions and&#xA;then only may you quench your thirst.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Like Nakula, Sahadeva also did not heed&#xA;the warning. He drank the water and at&#xA;once dropped down.&#xA;Puzzled and worried that Sahadeva also&#xA;did not return, Yudhishthira sent Arjuna to&#xA;see whether the brothers had met with any&#xA;danger. &amp;ldquo;And bring water,&amp;rdquo; he added, for&#xA;he was very thirsty.&#xA;Arjuna went swiftly. He saw both his&#xA;brothers lying dead near the pool. He was&#xA;shocked at the sight and felt that they&#xA;must have been killed by some lurking&#xA;foe.&#xA;Though heart-broken with grief and&#xA;burning with the desire for revenge, he&#xA;felt all feelings submerged in a monstrous&#xA;thirst, which irresistibly impelled him to&#xA;the fatal pool. Again, a voice was heard:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Answer my question before you drink the&#xA;water. This pool is mine. If you disobey&#xA;me, you will follow your brothers.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s anger knew no bounds. He cried:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Who are you? Come and stand up to me,&#xA;and I will kill you,&amp;rdquo; and he shot keen-&#xA;edged arrows in the direction of the voice.&#xA;The invisible being laughed in scorn:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Your arrows do but wound the air.&#xA;Answer my questions and then you can&#xA;satisfy your thirst. If you drink the water&#xA;without doing so, you will die.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Greatly vexed, Arjuna made up his mind&#xA;to seek out and grapple with this elusive&#xA;foe. But first he had to quench his terrible&#xA;thirst. Yes, thirst was the enemy he must&#xA;kill first. So he drank the water and also&#xA;fell down dead.&#xA;After anxious waiting Yudhishthira turned&#xA;to Bhima: &amp;ldquo;Dear brother, Arjuna, the great&#xA;hero, has also not yet returned. Something&#xA;terrible must have happened to our&#xA;brothers, for our stars are bad. Please seek&#xA;them out and be quick about it. Also bring&#xA;water, for I die of thirst.&amp;rdquo; Bhima, racked&#xA;with anxiety, hurried away without a&#xA;word.&#xA;His grief and rage can be imagined when&#xA;he saw his three brothers lying there dead.&#xA;He thought: &amp;ldquo;This is certainly the work of&#xA;the Yakshas. I will hunt them down and&#xA;kill them. But O! I am so thirsty, I shall&#xA;first drink water the better to fight them.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And then he descended into the pool.&#xA;The voice shouted: &amp;ldquo;Bhimasena, beware.&#xA;You may drink only after answering my&#xA;questions. You will die if you disregard&#xA;my words.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Who are you to dictate to me?&amp;rdquo; cried&#xA;Bhima, and he drank the water avidly,&#xA;glaring around in defiance. And as he did&#xA;so, his great strength seemed to slip from&#xA;him like a garment. And he also fell dead&#xA;among his brothers.&#xA;Alone, Yudhishthira wailed full of anxiety&#xA;and thirst. &amp;ldquo;Have they been subjected to a&#xA;curse or are they wandering about in theforest in a vain search for water or have&#xA;they fainted or died of thirst?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Unable to bear these thoughts and driven&#xA;desperate by an overpowering thirst, he&#xA;started out to look for his brothers and the&#xA;pool.&#xA;Yudhishthira proceeded in the direction&#xA;his brothers had taken through tracts&#xA;infested with wild boar and abounding in&#xA;spotted dear and huge forest birds.&#xA;Presently he came upon a beautiful green&#xA;meadow, girdling a pool of pellucid water,&#xA;nectar to his eyes.&#xA;But when he saw his brothers lying there&#xA;like sacred flagpoles thrown pell-mell&#xA;after a festival, unable to restrain his grief,&#xA;he lifted his voice and wept. He stroked&#xA;the faces of Bhima and Arjuna as they lay&#xA;so still and silent there and mourned:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Was this to be the end of all our vows?&#xA;Just when our exile is about to end, you&#xA;have been snatched away. Even the gods&#xA;have forsaken me in my misfortune!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As he looked at their mighty limbs, now&#xA;so helpless, he sadly wondered who could&#xA;have been powerful enough to kill them.&#xA;Brokenly, he reflected: &amp;ldquo;Surely my heart&#xA;must be made of steel not to break even&#xA;after seeing Nakula and Sahadeva dead.&#xA;For what purpose should I continue to live&#xA;in this world?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then a sense of mystery overcame him,&#xA;for this could be no ordinary occurrence.&#xA;The world held no warriors who could&#xA;overcome his brothers. Besides, there&#xA;were no wounds on their bodies which&#xA;could have let out life and their faces were&#xA;faces of men who slept in peace and not of&#xA;those who died in wrath.&#xA;There was also no trace of the footprints&#xA;of an enemy. There was surely some&#xA;magic about it. Or, could it be a trick&#xA;played by Duryodhana? Might he not&#xA;have&#xA;poisoned&#xA;the&#xA;water?&#xA;Then&#xA;Yudhishthira also descended into the pool,&#xA;in his turn drawn to the water by a&#xA;consuming thirst.&#xA;At once the voice without form warned as&#xA;before: &amp;ldquo;Your brothers died because they&#xA;did not heed my words. Do not follow&#xA;them. Answer my questions first and then&#xA;quench your thirst. This pool is mine.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira knew that these could be&#xA;none other than the words of a Yaksha&#xA;and guessed what had happened to his&#xA;brothers. He saw a possible way of&#xA;redeeming the situation.&#xA;He said to the bodiless voice: &amp;ldquo;Please ask&#xA;your questions.&amp;rdquo; The voice put questions&#xA;rapidly one after another.&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What makes sun&#xA;shine every day?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;The power of&#xA;Brahman.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What rescues man in&#xA;danger?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Courage is man&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;salvation in danger.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;By the study of which&#xA;science does man become wise?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Not by studying&#xA;any sastra does man become wise. It is by&#xA;association with the great in wisdom that&#xA;he gets wisdom.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What is more nobly&#xA;sustaining than the earth?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;The mother who&#xA;brings up the children she has borne is&#xA;nobler and more sustaining than the&#xA;earth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What is higher than&#xA;the sky?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;The father.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What is fleeter than&#xA;wind?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Mind.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What is more&#xA;blighted than withered straw?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;A sorrow-stricken&#xA;heart.&amp;ldquo;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What befriends a&#xA;traveller?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Learning.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;Who is the friend of&#xA;one who stays at home?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;The wife.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;Who accompanies a&#xA;man in death?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Dharma. That&#xA;alone accompanies the soul in its solitary&#xA;journey after death.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;Which is the biggest&#xA;vessel?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;The earth, which&#xA;contains all within itself is the greatest&#xA;vessel.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What is happiness?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Happiness is the&#xA;result of good conduct.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What is that,&#xA;abandoning which man becomes loved by&#xA;all?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Pride,&#xA;for&#xA;abandoning that man will be loved by all.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What is the loss&#xA;which yields joy and not sorrow?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Anger, giving it up,&#xA;we will no longer subject to sorrow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What is that, by&#xA;giving up which, man becomes rich?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Desire, getting rid&#xA;of it, man becomes wealthy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What makes one a&#xA;real brahmana? Is it birth, good conduct or&#xA;learning? Answer decisively.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Birth and learning&#xA;do not make one a brahmana. Good&#xA;conduct alone does. However learned a&#xA;person may be he will not be a brahmana&#xA;if he is a slave to bad habits. Even though&#xA;he may be learned in the four Vedas, a&#xA;man of bad conduct falls to a lower class.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;What is the greatest&#xA;wonder in the world?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Every day, men see&#xA;creatures depart to Yama&amp;rsquo;s abode and yet,&#xA;those who remain seek to live forever.&#xA;This verily is the greatest wonder.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus, the Yaksha posed many questions&#xA;and Yudhishthira answered them all.&#xA;In the end the Yaksha asked: &amp;ldquo;O king, one&#xA;of your dead brothers can now be revived.&#xA;Whom do you want revived? He shall&#xA;come back to life.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira thought for a moment and&#xA;then&#xA;replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;May&#xA;the&#xA;cloud-&#xA;complexioned, lotus-eyed, broad-chested&#xA;and long-armed Nakula, lying like a fallen&#xA;ebony tree, arise.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yaksha was pleased at this and asked&#xA;Yudhishthira: &amp;ldquo;Why did you choose&#xA;Nakula in preference to Bhima who has&#xA;the&#xA;strength&#xA;of&#xA;sixteen&#xA;thousand&#xA;elephants? I have heard that Bhima is&#xA;most dear to you. And why not Arjuna,&#xA;whose prowess in arms is your protection?&#xA;Tell me why you chose Nakula rather than&#xA;either of these two.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;O Yaksha, dharma&#xA;is the only shield of man and not Bhima or&#xA;Arjuna. If dharma is set at naught, man&#xA;will be ruined. Kunti and Madri were the&#xA;two wives of my father. I am surviving, a&#xA;son of Kunti, and so, she is not completely&#xA;bereaved. In order that the scales of&#xA;justice may be even, I ask that Madri&amp;rsquo;s son&#xA;Nakula may revive.&amp;rdquo; The Yaksha was&#xA;pleased with Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s impartiality&#xA;and granted that all his brothers would&#xA;come back to life.&#xA;It was Yama, the Lord of Death, who had&#xA;taken the form of the deer and the Yaksha&#xA;so that he might see his son Yudhishthira&#xA;and test him. He embraced Yudhishthira&#xA;and blessed him.&#xA;Yama said: &amp;ldquo;Only a few days remain to&#xA;complete the stipulated period of your&#xA;exile in the forest. The thirteenth year will&#xA;also pass by. None of your enemies will&#xA;be able to discover you. You will&#xA;successfully fulfil your undertaking,&amp;rdquo; and&#xA;saying this he disappeared.The Pandavas had, no doubt, to pass&#xA;through all sorts of troubles during their&#xA;exile, but the gains too were not&#xA;inconsiderable. It was a period of hard&#xA;discipline&#xA;and&#xA;searching&#xA;probation&#xA;through which they emerged stronger and&#xA;nobler men.&#xA;Arjuna returned from tapas with divine&#xA;weapons and strengthened by contact with&#xA;Indra. Bhima also met his elder brother&#xA;Hanuman near the lake where the&#xA;Saugandhika flowers bloomed and got&#xA;tenfold strength from his embrace. Having&#xA;met, at the enchanted pool, his father&#xA;Yama, the Lord of Dharma, Yudhishthira&#xA;shone with tenfold lustre.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The minds of those who listen to the&#xA;sacred story of Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s meeting&#xA;with his father, will never go after evil.&#xA;They will never seek to create quarrels&#xA;among friends or covet the wealth of&#xA;others. They will never fall victims to lust.&#xA;They will never be unduly attached to&#xA;transitory&#xA;things.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus&#xA;said&#xA;Vaisampayana to Janamejaya as he related&#xA;this story of the Yaksha. May the same&#xA;good attend the readers of this story as&#xA;retold by us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;O BRAHMANAS, we have been&#xA;deceived by the sons of Dhritarashtra,&#xA;cheated out of our kingdom and reduced&#xA;to poverty. Still we have passed these&#xA;years cheerfully with joy in the forest. The&#xA;thirteenth year of exile has come, and with&#xA;it the time for us to part from you. For we&#xA;have to spend the next twelve months&#xA;undiscovered by the spies of Duryodhana.&#xA;God knows when the day will dawn which&#xA;will see us together again, without fear or&#xA;concealment. Now, bless us before we go.&#xA;And may we escape the notice of those&#xA;who may wish to betray us to the sons of&#xA;Dhritarashtra, either through fear or hope&#xA;of reward.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So spoke Yudhishthira to the brahmanas&#xA;who were living with the Pandavas till&#xA;then. His voice shook with emotion as he&#xA;spoke these words.&#xA;Dhaumya consoled him. He said: &amp;ldquo;Parting,&#xA;is hard, and the dangers are many and&#xA;great. But you are too wise and learned to&#xA;be shaken or daunted. You must disguise&#xA;yourselves. Indra, the Lord of gods, when&#xA;pested by the demons, disguised himself&#xA;as a brahmana and lived unknown in the&#xA;country of Nishadha. Safely concealed&#xA;thus, he managed to destroy his enemies.&#xA;You must also do likewise. Did not&#xA;Mahavishnu, the Lord of the Universe,&#xA;become a child in the womb of Aditi,&#xA;suffer human birth, and take away from&#xA;Emperor Bali his kingdom for the&#xA;salvation of the world? Did not Lord&#xA;Narayana, the refuge of men, enter into&#xA;the weapon of Indra to defeat Vritra, the&#xA;asura king? Did not the Fire god hide&#xA;himself in the waters for the sake of the&#xA;gods? Does not the moon keep out of&#xA;sight every day? Did not Lord Vishnu, the&#xA;all-pervading God, descend as the son of&#xA;Dasaratha and spend long years, suffering&#xA;many sorrows for the sake of killing&#xA;Ravana? The greatest souls in the past&#xA;have sanctified disguise for a good&#xA;purpose. You will, likewise, conquer your&#xA;enemies and win prosperity.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira took leave of the brahmanas&#xA;and gave the members of his retinue leave&#xA;to go home. The Pandavas retired to a&#xA;secluded spot in the forest and discussed&#xA;their future line of action. Yudhishthira&#xA;sadly asked Arjuna: &amp;ldquo;You are well&#xA;conversant with the ways of the world.&#xA;Where would it be best for us to spend the&#xA;thirteenth year?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna replied: &amp;ldquo;O great king, you know&#xA;Yama, the Lord of Death, has blessed us.&#xA;We can easily pass the twelve months&#xA;together without being discovered. There&#xA;are many charming states for us to choosefrom for our sojourn, states like Panchala,&#xA;Matsya,&#xA;Salva,&#xA;Videha,&#xA;Bahlika,&#xA;Dasharna,&#xA;Surasena,&#xA;Kalinga,&#xA;and&#xA;Magadha. It is, of course, for you to&#xA;choose. But if I may venture an opinion,&#xA;the Matsya country of king Virata is the&#xA;best, prosperous and charming as it is.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira answered: &amp;ldquo;Virata, the king&#xA;of Matsya, is very strong and he loves us&#xA;much. He is of mature judgment and is&#xA;devoted to the practice of virtue. He will&#xA;not be won over or frightened by&#xA;Duryodhana. I agree that it would be best&#xA;to live incognito in Virata&amp;rsquo;s kingdom.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna said: &amp;ldquo;Well then, O king, what&#xA;work would you seek in the court of&#xA;Virata?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When he asked this question, Arjuna was&#xA;full of sorrow at the thought of&#xA;Yudhishthira, the great and guileless king,&#xA;who had performed the Rajasuya&#xA;sacrifice, having to disguise himself and&#xA;take service.&#xA;Yudhishthira answered: &amp;ldquo;I am thinking of&#xA;asking Virata to take me in his service as a&#xA;courtier. I could delight him with my&#xA;conversation and my dexterity at dice. I&#xA;shall take the garb of a sanyasin and shall&#xA;keep him agreeably engaged by my skill&#xA;in reading omens and knowledge&#xA;ofastrology as well as of the Vedas,&#xA;Vedangas, ethics, politics and other&#xA;sciences. I shall have to be careful of&#xA;course, but be not anxious about me. I&#xA;shall tell him that I was an intimate friend&#xA;of Yudhishthira and learnt these things&#xA;while I was privileged to be with him. O&#xA;Bhima, what works will you, who&#xA;conquered and slew Baka and Hidimba,&#xA;take up under Virata? You saved us by&#xA;killing Jatasura. Valor and strength are&#xA;over-flowing from you. What disguise can&#xA;hide your mighty personality and enable&#xA;you to live unknown in the country of&#xA;Mastya?&amp;rdquo; Yudhishthira was in tears as he&#xA;put this question to Bhima.&#xA;Bhima laughingly replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O king, I&#xA;think of taking service as a cook in the&#xA;court of Virata. You know that I have a&#xA;great appetite and that I am also an expert&#xA;in cooking. I shall please Virata by&#xA;preparing such dainty food as he has never&#xA;tasted. I shall chop the trees of the forest&#xA;and bring heaps of fuel. I shall also delight&#xA;the king by contending with and defeating&#xA;the wrestlers who come to his court.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This made Yudhishthira anxious for he&#xA;feared that danger might befall them if&#xA;Bhima engaged himself in wrestling&#xA;bouts. At once Bhima spoke thus to calm&#xA;his fears:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I shall not kill anyone. I may give a bad&#xA;jolt to any wrestler who deserves it but I&#xA;shall not kill anyone. I shall restrain mad&#xA;bulls, buffaloes and other wild animals&#xA;and thus entertain king Virata.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Afterwards&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;addressed&#xA;Arjuna: &amp;ldquo;What profession do you propose&#xA;to take up? How can you hide your&#xA;towering valor?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When he asked this question Yudhishthira&#xA;could not restrain him from narrating the&#xA;brilliant exploits of Arjuna. He spoke of&#xA;his brother&amp;rsquo;s glory in twenty verses. Well,&#xA;who deserves praise if not Arjuna?&#xA;Arjuna replied: &amp;ldquo;Revered brother, I shall&#xA;hide myself in the guise of a eunuch and&#xA;serve the ladies of the court. I shall hide&#xA;under a jacket the scars on my arms made&#xA;by the constant chafing of the bowstring.&#xA;When I rejected Urvasi&amp;rsquo;s amorous&#xA;overtures on the ground that she was like&#xA;a mother unto me, she cursed me with loss&#xA;of manhood. But through Indra&amp;rsquo;s grace the&#xA;curse would hold good only for a year,&#xA;and the time would be mine to choose. I&#xA;shall serve out that year of loss of&#xA;manhood now. Wearing bangles made of&#xA;white conchs, braiding my hair like a&#xA;woman, and clothing myself in female&#xA;attire, I shall engage myself in menial&#xA;work in the inner apartments of Virata&amp;rsquo;squeen. I shall teach the women singing&#xA;and dancing. And I shall seek service&#xA;saying that I used to serve Draupadi in&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s court.&amp;rdquo; Saying this, Arjuna&#xA;turned to Draupadi and smiled.&#xA;Yudhishthira was in tears. &amp;ldquo;Alas! Have the&#xA;fates decreed that he, who is the equal of&#xA;Sri Krishna himself in fame and valor, a&#xA;scion of Bharata&amp;rsquo;s line, who stands high&#xA;like the great golden Mount Meru, must&#xA;go and seek employment of Virata as a&#xA;eunuch in the queen&amp;rsquo;s inner apartments?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he said brokenly.&#xA;Yudhishthira then turned to Nakula and&#xA;asked him what work he would engage in&#xA;and, as he thought of Madri, the mother of&#xA;Nakula, tears rolled down his eyes.&#xA;Nakula replied: &amp;ldquo;I shall work in King&#xA;Virata&amp;rsquo;s stables. My mind delights in&#xA;training and looking after horses. For I&#xA;know the heart of horses and have&#xA;knowledge of their ailments and cure. I&#xA;can not only ride and break horses but&#xA;also harness and drive them in a chariot. I&#xA;shall say that I had looked after the horses&#xA;of the Pandavas and I have no doubt&#xA;Virata will take me in his service.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira asked Sahadeva: &amp;ldquo;You, with&#xA;the intelligence of Brihaspati, the priest&#xA;and the preceptor of the gods, and the&#xA;knowledge of Sukra, the teacher of the&#xA;asuras, what work will you take up?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sahadeva replied: &amp;ldquo;Let Nakula look after&#xA;horses. I shall tend the cows. I shall guard&#xA;Virata&amp;rsquo;s cattle from the ravages of disease&#xA;and the attacks of wild beasts.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Draupadi,&amp;rdquo; but Yudhishthira could not&#xA;find words to ask her what she proposed&#xA;to do. She was dearer to him than life&#xA;itself, worthy of all reverence and&#xA;protection, and it seemed sacrilege to talk&#xA;of service. She was a princess, the&#xA;daughter of a king, nobly born, tenderly&#xA;nurtured. Yudhishthira felt choked by&#xA;shame and despair.&#xA;Draupadi saw his grief and spoke these&#xA;brave words: &amp;ldquo;O best of kings, do not&#xA;grieve or suffer anxiety on my account. I&#xA;shall be a sairandhri in the court of the&#xA;queen of Virata, the companion and&#xA;attendant of the princess. I shall preserve&#xA;my freedom and chastity, for the attendant&#xA;and companion of a princess has this right&#xA;and can exercise it. I shall pass my days in&#xA;such light tasks as braiding the hair and&#xA;entertaining the women of the court with&#xA;small talk. I shall represent that I had thus&#xA;served&#xA;princess&#xA;Draupadi&#xA;in&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s court and seek employment&#xA;from the queen. Thus shall I remain&#xA;unknown to others.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira praised Draupadi&amp;rsquo;s courage&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;O auspicious one, you speak as&#xA;befits one of your family.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When the Pandavas thus decided,&#xA;Dhaumya blessed them and advised them&#xA;thus: &amp;ldquo;Those who are engaged in service&#xA;under a king should always be vigilant.&#xA;They must serve without talking too&#xA;much. They may give their counsel only&#xA;when asked, and never obtrude it. They&#xA;should praise the king on befitting&#xA;occasions. All things, no matter how&#xA;small, may be done only after informing&#xA;the king, who is a veritable fire in human&#xA;form. Do not go too near him, nor yet&#xA;appear to avoid him. Even though a&#xA;person may be trusted by the king and&#xA;have great authority, still be should&#xA;always behave as if he would be&#xA;dismissed immediately, It would be&#xA;foolishness to place too much confidence&#xA;in a king. One may not sit in the&#xA;conveyance, seat or chariot of the king,&#xA;presuming on his affection. A servant of&#xA;the king should ever be active and self-&#xA;restrained. He should not be excessively&#xA;elated, nor unduly depressed, by being&#xA;honored or dishonored by the king. He&#xA;may not reveal the secrets confided to&#xA;him, nor may he receive anything in theform of gift from the citizens. He should&#xA;not be jealous of other servants. The king&#xA;may place fools in positions of authority,&#xA;leaving aside the wise. Such waywardness&#xA;should be ignored. One cannot be too&#xA;careful with the ladies of the court. There&#xA;should not be the faintest suggestion of&#xA;indelicacy in one&amp;rsquo;s conduct towards&#xA;them.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhaumya then blessed the Pandavas:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Live thus in patience for one year,&#xA;serving the king Virata, and then, you will&#xA;pass the rest of your days in happiness,&#xA;regaining your lost throne.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YUDHISHTHIRA put on the garb of a&#xA;sanyasin. Arjuna transformed himself into&#xA;a&#xA;eunuch.&#xA;Others&#xA;also&#xA;disguised&#xA;themselves. But no disguise could take&#xA;away their natural charm, grace and&#xA;nobility of appearance.&#xA;When they went to King Virata seeking&#xA;service, they seemed to him born to&#xA;command and rule rather than to serve. He&#xA;hesitated, at first, to engage them in&#xA;service but yielding to their urgent&#xA;solicitations, he finally appointed them to&#xA;the places they sought of him.&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;became&#xA;the&#xA;king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;companion and spent his days in playing&#xA;dice with him. Bhima worked as the chief&#xA;of the cooks. He also entertained the king&#xA;by wrestling with the reputed men of&#xA;might whom came to the court, and by&#xA;controlling wild animals.&#xA;Arjuna assumed the name of Brihannala&#xA;and&#xA;taught&#xA;dancing,&#xA;singing&#xA;and&#xA;instrumental music to Princess Uttara, the&#xA;daughter of Virata, and the ladies. Nakula&#xA;looked after the horses and Sahadeva&#xA;looked after the cows and the bulls.&#xA;The princess Draupadi who, if fate had&#xA;been less cruel, should herself have been&#xA;served by many maids, had now to pass&#xA;her days in serving Sudeshna, Virata&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;queen. She lived in the inner apartments&#xA;of the palace as maid and companion,&#xA;engaging herself in uncongenial tasks.&#xA;Kichaka, the brother of Sudeshna, was the&#xA;commander-in-chief of Virata&amp;rsquo;s army and&#xA;it was to him that the old king Virata&#xA;owed his power and prestige. Kichaka&#xA;wielded such vast influence that people&#xA;used to say that Kichaka was the real king&#xA;of the Matsya country and old Virata king&#xA;only in name.&#xA;Kichaka was inordinately vain of his&#xA;strength and his influence over the king.&#xA;He was so smitten with Draupadi&amp;rsquo;s beauty&#xA;that he conceived an uncontrollable&#xA;passion for her. And he was so sure of his&#xA;own attractions and power that it never&#xA;occurred to him that she, though a mere&#xA;maidservant could resist his will. He made&#xA;amorous overtures to her, which greatly&#xA;vexed her.&#xA;Draupadi was too shy to speak of this to&#xA;Sudeshna or to others. She gave out that&#xA;her husbands were Gandharvas who&#xA;would mysteriously kill those who tried to&#xA;dishonor her.&#xA;Her good conduct and lustre made every&#xA;one believe in her story about the&#xA;Gandharvas. But Kichaka was not to be&#xA;frightened so easily and he sought&#xA;persistently to seduce Draupadi.&#xA;His persecution became so intolerable that&#xA;at last she complained of it to Queen&#xA;Sudeshna, and implored her protection.&#xA;Kichaka, of course, had greater influence&#xA;over his sister, and he shamelessly&#xA;confided to her his unlawful passion for&#xA;her maid and sought her aid to compass&#xA;his wish.&#xA;He represented himself as dying of desire.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I am so full of torment,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;that&#xA;from the time I met your maid, I do not&#xA;get any sleep or rest. You must save my&#xA;life by managing somehow to make her&#xA;receive my advances favorably.&amp;rdquo; The&#xA;queen tried to dissuade him but Kichaka&#xA;would not listen. And finally Sudeshnayielded. Both of them decided upon a plan&#xA;to entrap Draupadi.&#xA;One night, many sweetmeats and&#xA;intoxicating drinks were prepared in the&#xA;house of Kichaka and a great feast was&#xA;arranged. Sudeshna called Sairandhri to&#xA;her side and handing her a beautiful&#xA;golden jug bade her go and bring her a jug&#xA;of wine from Kichaka&amp;rsquo;s house.&#xA;Draupadi hesitated to go to the house of&#xA;the infatuated Kichaka at that hour and&#xA;begged hard that someone else of her&#xA;many attendants might be sent, but&#xA;Sudeshna did not listen. She pretended to&#xA;be angry and said sharply: &amp;ldquo;Go, you must.&#xA;I can not send anyone else,&amp;rdquo; and poor&#xA;Draupadi had to obey.&#xA;Draupadi&amp;rsquo;s fears were justified. When she&#xA;reached Kichaka&amp;rsquo;s house, that wretch,&#xA;maddened with lust and wine, began to&#xA;pester her with urgent entreaties and&#xA;solicitations.&#xA;She rejected his prayers and said: &amp;ldquo;Why&#xA;do you, who belong to a noble royal&#xA;family, seek me, born of a low caste?&#xA;Why do you take to the wrong path? Why&#xA;do you approach me, a married lady? You&#xA;will&#xA;perish.&#xA;My&#xA;protectors,&#xA;the&#xA;Gandharvas, will kill you in their anger.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Draupadi would not yield to his&#xA;entreaties, Kichaka seized her by the arm&#xA;and pulled her about. But putting down&#xA;the vessel she carried, she wrenched&#xA;herself free and fled, hotly pursued by the&#xA;maddened Kichaka.&#xA;She fled to the court wailing loudly. But&#xA;even there, intoxicated not only with&#xA;wine, but even more by his power and&#xA;influence, Kichaka followed her and&#xA;kicked her in the presence of all with&#xA;abusive words.&#xA;Everyone was afraid of the all-powerful&#xA;commander-in-chief and no one was bold&#xA;enough to oppose him.&#xA;Draupadi could not bear the sorrow and&#xA;anger she felt at the thought of her&#xA;helplessness under the intolerable insult&#xA;offered to her.&#xA;Her deep distress made her forget the&#xA;danger that would befall the Pandavas if&#xA;they were discovered prematurely. She&#xA;went that night to Bhima and waking him&#xA;up, gave vent to her agonized sense of&#xA;wrong.&#xA;After telling him how brutally Kichaka&#xA;had pursued and insulted her, she&#xA;appealed&#xA;piteously&#xA;to&#xA;Bhima&#xA;for&#xA;protection and revenge. She said in a&#xA;voice choked with sobs:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I cannot bear this any longer. You must&#xA;kill this wretch at once. For your sake, to&#xA;help you keep your promise, I serve in a&#xA;menial office and even prepare sandal&#xA;paste for Virata. I have not minded it, I,&#xA;who have till now served only you or&#xA;Mother Kunti, whom I love and honor.&#xA;But now, I have to serve these wretches,&#xA;fearful every moment of some disgraceful&#xA;outrage. Not that I mind hard work, see&#xA;my hands.&amp;rdquo; And she showed her hands,&#xA;which were cracked and stained with&#xA;menial tasks.&#xA;Bhima respectfully carried her hands to&#xA;his face and eyes, and speechless with&#xA;sorrow and pity and love, he dried her&#xA;tears. Finally he found his voice, and said&#xA;thickly:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I care not for the promise of Yudhishthira&#xA;or the advice of Arjuna. I care not what&#xA;may happen but I will do as you say. I will&#xA;kill Kichaka and his gang here and now!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;and he rose.&#xA;But Draupadi warned Bhima not to be&#xA;hasty. They talked it over and finally&#xA;decided that Kichaka should be beguiled&#xA;to come alone at night to a retired spot in&#xA;the dancing hall where he should find&#xA;waiting for him Bhima disguised as a&#xA;woman, instead of Draupadi.&#xA;Next morning, Kichaka renewed his&#xA;hateful attentions and vaingloriously said&#xA;to Draupadi: &amp;ldquo;O Sairandhri, I threw youdown and kicked you in the presence of&#xA;the king. Did any one there come forward&#xA;to help you? Virata is only king in name&#xA;of this Matsya country. But I, the&#xA;commander-in-chief,&#xA;am&#xA;the&#xA;real&#xA;sovereign. Now, do not be a fool, but&#xA;come and enjoy life with me, with all&#xA;royal honors. I shall be your devoted&#xA;servant.&amp;rdquo; And he begged and bullied and&#xA;cringed, devouring her the while with lust-&#xA;reddened eyes.&#xA;Draupadi pretended to yield and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Kichaka, believe me, I can no longer&#xA;resist your solicitations. But none of your&#xA;companions or brothers should know of&#xA;our relations. If you swear that you will&#xA;faithfully keep the secret from others, I&#xA;shall yield to your wish.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kichaka delightedly agreed to the&#xA;condition and he promised to go alone to a&#xA;place of assignation that very night.&#xA;She said: &amp;ldquo;The women have their dancing&#xA;lessons during daytime in the dancing hall&#xA;and return to their own quarters at&#xA;nightfall. None will be in the dancing hall&#xA;at night. Come there tonight. I shall be&#xA;waiting for you there. You can have your&#xA;will of me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kichaka reveled in happiness. That night,&#xA;Kichaka took his bath, perfumed and&#xA;decked himself, went to the dancing hall&#xA;and finding with joy that the doors were&#xA;open, gently entered the place.&#xA;In the very dim light, he saw someone&#xA;lying there on a couch, no doubt&#xA;Sairandhri. He groped his way in the dark,&#xA;and gently laid his hands on the person of&#xA;the sleeper.&#xA;Alas! It was not the soft form of&#xA;Sairandhri that he touched but the iron&#xA;frame of Bhima who lept forth on him like&#xA;a lion on its prey and hurled him to the&#xA;ground. But surprised as he was, Kichaka&#xA;was no coward, and he was now fighting&#xA;for dear life.&#xA;Grimly they wrestled, Kichaka no doubt&#xA;thinking he had to do with one of the&#xA;Gandharva husbands. They were not ill&#xA;matched, for at that time Bhima, Balarama&#xA;and Kichaka were reputed to be in the&#xA;same class in strength and wrestling skill.&#xA;The struggle between Bhima and Kichaka&#xA;was like that between Vali and Sugriva. In&#xA;the end Bhima killed Kichaka, pounding&#xA;and kneading his body into a shapeless&#xA;lump of flesh.&#xA;Then he gave the glad news of Kichaka&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;punishment to Draupadi and went in haste&#xA;to his kitchen, bathed, rubbed sandal paste&#xA;over his body and slept with satisfaction.&#xA;Draupadi awoke the guards of the court&#xA;and said to them: &amp;ldquo;Kichaka came to&#xA;molest me, but as I had warned him, the&#xA;Gandharvas, my husbands, made short&#xA;work of him. Your commander-in-chief,&#xA;who fell a prey to lust, has been killed.&#xA;Look at him.&amp;rdquo; And she showed them the&#xA;corpse of Kichaka, which had been&#xA;reduced to such a shapeless mass that it&#xA;had no human semblance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE fate of Kichaka made Draupadi an&#xA;object of fear to the people of Virata.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This woman, so beautiful that she&#xA;captures all hearts, is as dangerous as she&#xA;is lovely, for the Gandharvas guard her.&#xA;She is a great danger to the people of the&#xA;city and the members of the royal&#xA;household, for the Gandharvas may stop&#xA;at nothing in their jealous anger. It would&#xA;be best to send her out of the city.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Reflecting thus, the citizens went to&#xA;Sudeshna and prayed to her to expel&#xA;Draupadi.&#xA;Sudeshna told Draupadi: &amp;ldquo;You are, no&#xA;doubt, a very virtuous lady, but kindly&#xA;leave our city. I have had enough of you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;There was only one month more to&#xA;complete the stipulated period of living&#xA;incognito and Draupadi begged earnestly&#xA;to be permitted to stay just another monthby when, she said, her Gandharva&#xA;husbands would have realised their&#xA;objects and would be ready to take her&#xA;away with them.&#xA;The Gandharvas would be very grateful to&#xA;King Virata and his kingdom. Whether&#xA;grateful or not, the Gandharvas could be&#xA;deadly if irritated and Sudeshna was too&#xA;afraid of Draupadi to refuse her request.&#xA;From the beginning of the thirteenth year,&#xA;the spies of Duryodhana, under his&#xA;express orders, had searched for the&#xA;Pandavas in all possible places of hiding.&#xA;After several months of futile search, they&#xA;reported their failure to Duryodhana and&#xA;added that probably the Pandavas had&#xA;perished of privations.&#xA;Then came the news that the powerful&#xA;Kichaka had been killed in single combat&#xA;by some Gandharva on account of a&#xA;woman.&#xA;There were only two persons who could&#xA;kill Kichaka, and Bhima was one of them.&#xA;And so they suspected that Bhima might&#xA;have been the vengeful Gandharva who&#xA;had killed Kichaka. Duryodhana also felt&#xA;that the lady who was the cause of the&#xA;killing might be Draupadi. He expressed&#xA;his doubts in the open assembly.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;I suspect that the Pandavas are&#xA;in Virata&amp;rsquo;s city. Now, he is one of the&#xA;kings who are too stiff-necked to court our&#xA;friendship. It would be a good thing to&#xA;invade his country and carry away his&#xA;cows. If the Pandavas are hiding there,&#xA;they will certainly come out to fight with&#xA;us to repay Virata&amp;rsquo;s hospitality and we can&#xA;easily spot them. If we discover them&#xA;there and we can sure before the stipulated&#xA;time, they will have to go to the forest&#xA;again for another twelve, years. If, on the&#xA;other hand, the Pandavas are not there,&#xA;there is nothing lost.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;King Susarma, the ruler of Trigarta&#xA;heartily supported him. &amp;ldquo;The king of&#xA;Matsya is my enemy.&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;and&#xA;Kichaka has given me a lot of trouble.&#xA;Kichaka&amp;rsquo;s death must have weakened&#xA;Virata considerably. Give me leave to&#xA;attack Virata now.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Karna seconded this proposition. They&#xA;unanimously came to the decision that&#xA;Susarma should attack Matsya from the&#xA;south and draw off the army of Virata to&#xA;the south for defence. Duryodhana, with&#xA;the Kaurava army, would then launch a&#xA;surprise attack on Virata from the&#xA;northern side, which would be relatively&#xA;undefended.&#xA;Susarma invaded Matsya from the south&#xA;seized the cattle and laid waste the&#xA;gardens and fields on the way. The&#xA;cowherds ran in great distress to Virata,&#xA;who now very much wished that Kichaka&#xA;were alive, for he surely would have made&#xA;short work of the raiders. When he said so&#xA;to Kanka (the assumed name by which&#xA;Yudhishthira was known in Virata&amp;rsquo;s court)&#xA;the latter said: &amp;ldquo;O king, be not worried.&#xA;Even though I am a hermit, I am an expert&#xA;in warfare. I shall put on armor and go in&#xA;a chariot and drive away your enemies.&#xA;Please instruct that your horse keeper&#xA;Dharmagranthi, your chief cook Valala,&#xA;and your stable herd Tantripala may also&#xA;get into chariots and help us. I have heard&#xA;that they are great fighters. Kindly give&#xA;orders that the necessary chariots and the&#xA;weapons may be given to us.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Delighted, Virata was only too willing to&#xA;accept the offer. The chariots were ready.&#xA;All the Pandavas excepting Arjuna went&#xA;out with the army of Virata to oppose&#xA;Susarma and his men.&#xA;A fierce fight ensued between the armies&#xA;of Virata and Susarma, with much loss of&#xA;life on both sides. Susarma attacked&#xA;Virata and surrounded his chariot,&#xA;compelling him to get down and fight on&#xA;foot.&#xA;Susarma captured Virata and held him&#xA;captive in his chariot. With the capture ofVirata, the army of Matsya lost heart and&#xA;began to scatter in all directions, when&#xA;Yudhishthira commanded Bhima to attack&#xA;Susarma and release Virata and rally the&#xA;scattered Matsya forces.&#xA;At these words of Yudhishthira, Bhima&#xA;was about to uproot a tree, but&#xA;Yudhishthira stopped him and said: &amp;ldquo;No&#xA;such tricks, please, and no battle cry or&#xA;your identity will be revealed. Fight like&#xA;anybody else from the chariot with your&#xA;bows and arrows.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhima accordingly got into the chariot&#xA;attacked the enemy, set Virata free and&#xA;captured Susarma. The dispersed forces of&#xA;Matsya rallied into new formations&#xA;charged and defeated the army of&#xA;Susarma.&#xA;As soon as the news of Susarma&amp;rsquo;s defeat&#xA;reached the city, the people were&#xA;extremely jubilant. They decorated the&#xA;city and went forth to welcome their&#xA;victorious king back home.&#xA;When they were thus making preparations&#xA;to receive king Virata, the big army of&#xA;Duryodhana came down on them from the&#xA;north, and began despoiling the cattle&#xA;ranches on the outskirts of the city.&#xA;The Kaurava army marched in force and&#xA;rounded up the countless cows that were&#xA;there. The leader of the cowherds ran to&#xA;the city and said to the prince Uttara: &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;prince, the Kauravas are marching on,&#xA;robbing us of our cows. King Virata has&#xA;gone south to fight against the Trigarta.&#xA;We are in consternation as there is no one&#xA;to protect us. You are the king&amp;rsquo;s son and&#xA;we look to you for protection. Pray, come&#xA;and recover the cows for the honor of&#xA;your family.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When the leader of the cowherds made&#xA;this complaint to Uttara in the presence of&#xA;the people and especially of the women of&#xA;the palace, the prince felt flushed with&#xA;valor and proudly said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If only I can get someone to be my&#xA;charioteer I will recover the cows single-&#xA;handed. Well, my feats of arms will be&#xA;worth seeing and people will know there&#xA;is little to choose between Arjuna and&#xA;myself.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Uttara said these words Draupadi&#xA;was in the inner apartments and must have&#xA;laughed within herself.&#xA;She ran to princess Uttara and said: &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;princess, great danger has be fallen the&#xA;country. The cowherds have complained&#xA;to the young that the Kaurava army is&#xA;advancing on our city from the north and&#xA;has captured cattle ranches and cows on&#xA;the outskirts. The prince is eager to fight&#xA;them and is in need of a charioteer.&#xA;Should such a small thing as that stand in&#xA;the way of victory and glory? I tell you&#xA;that Brihannala has been Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;charioteer. When I was in the service of&#xA;the queen of the Pandavas, I heard of this&#xA;fact and I also know that Brihannala learnt&#xA;archery from Arjuna. Order Brihannala&#xA;immediately to go and drive the prince&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna as Brihannala pretended to be&#xA;unfamiliar with armor and raised a laugh&#xA;at his awkwardness in wearing it.&#xA;The women of the palace laughed at his&#xA;fears and told him again not to be afraid&#xA;for Uttara would look after him.&#xA;Arjuna spent some time in such fun but,&#xA;when he harnessed the horses, it could be&#xA;seen that, at least, he was an expert&#xA;charioteer. And when he held the reins,&#xA;the horses seemed to love and obey him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The prince will be victorious. We shall&#xA;despoil the enemy of their embroidered&#xA;robes and distribute them to you as the&#xA;prize of victory&amp;rdquo; were the last words of&#xA;Brihannala to the women of the palace, as&#xA;the chariot rapidly bore the prince&#xA;outwards to battle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UTTARA, the son of Virata, set off with&#xA;enthusiasm from the city in his chariot&#xA;with Brihannala as his charioteer and&#xA;commanded the latter to drive quickly to&#xA;the place where the Kauravas had rounded&#xA;up the cows.&#xA;Willingly, the horses were put to their best&#xA;speed. And presently the Kaurava army&#xA;was sighted, at first a gleaming, line,&#xA;enveloped in a cloud of dust that seemed&#xA;to go up to the skies.&#xA;Going nearer, Uttara saw the great army&#xA;drew in battle by Bhishma, Drona, Kripa,&#xA;Duryodhana and Karna. At that sight, his&#xA;courage, which had been gradually drying&#xA;up during the rapid rush to the field, was&#xA;quite gone. His mouth went dry and his&#xA;hair stood on end.&#xA;His limbs were all in a tremble. He shut&#xA;his eyes with both his hands to keep out&#xA;the fearsome sight. He said:&amp;ldquo;How can I,&#xA;single-handed, attack an army? I have no&#xA;troops, since the king, my father, has&#xA;taken all available forces, leaving the city&#xA;unprotected. It is absurd to think that one&#xA;man can alone fight a well-equipped&#xA;army, led by world-renowned warrior! Oh&#xA;Brihannala, turn back the chariot.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Brihannala laughed and said: &amp;ldquo;O prince,&#xA;you started from the city, full of fierce&#xA;determination and the ladies expect great&#xA;things of you. The citizens also have put&#xA;their trust in you. Sairandhri praised me&#xA;and I have come at your request. If we&#xA;return without recovering the cows, we&#xA;shall become the laughing-stock of all. I&#xA;will not turn back the chariot. Let us stand&#xA;firm and fight. Have no fear.&amp;rdquo; With these&#xA;words Brihannala began to drive the&#xA;chariot towards the enemy and they&#xA;approached quite close to them.&#xA;Uttara&amp;rsquo;s distress was pitiable. He said in a&#xA;quaking voice: &amp;ldquo;I cannot do it, I simply&#xA;cannot. Let the Kauravas march off with&#xA;the cows and if the women laugh, let&#xA;them. I do not care. What sense is there in&#xA;fighting people who are immeasurably&#xA;stronger than we fight? Do not be a fool!&#xA;Turn back the chariot. Otherwise, I shall&#xA;jump out and walk back.&amp;rdquo; With these&#xA;words Uttara cast off his bows and&#xA;arrows, got down from the chariot and&#xA;began to fly towards the city, mad with&#xA;panic.&#xA;This should not be taken as something that&#xA;has never happened in life. Nor is Uttara&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;panic during his first battle, by any means,&#xA;singular.&#xA;Fear is a strong instinctive feeling, though&#xA;it can be overcome by will-power or&#xA;strong motives like love, shame or hate, or&#xA;more usually, by discipline.&#xA;Even&#xA;men&#xA;who&#xA;have&#xA;afterwards&#xA;distinguished themselves by heroic deeds&#xA;have confessed to having felt something&#xA;like panic fear, the first time they came&#xA;under fire. Uttara was by no means an&#xA;exceptional coward, for he fought and fell&#xA;gauntly at Kurukshetra.&#xA;Arjuna pursued the running prince,&#xA;shouting to him to stop and behave like a&#xA;Kshatriya. The braided hair of the&#xA;charioteer began to dance and his clothes&#xA;began to wave as he ran in pursuit of&#xA;Uttara. The prince fled hither and thither,&#xA;trying to dodge the hands that would stop&#xA;him.&#xA;Those of the Kaurava army, who could&#xA;see this spectacle, found it amusing.&#xA;Drona was puzzled at the sight of&#xA;Brihannala&#xA;who,&#xA;albeit&#xA;dressed&#xA;fantastically, seemed a man rigged out as&#xA;a woman and to remind him curiously of&#xA;Arjuna.&#xA;When he remarked about this, Karna said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;How can this be Arjuna? What does it&#xA;matter even if he is? What can Arjuna&#xA;alone do against us in the absence of the&#xA;other Pandavas? The king has left his son&#xA;alone in the city and gone with his whole&#xA;army to fight against Susarma. The young&#xA;prince has brought the attendant of theladies of the palace as his charioteer. That&#xA;is all.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Poor Uttara was imploring Brihannala to&#xA;let him go, promising untold wealth if he&#xA;did so. He appealed to his pity: &amp;ldquo;I am the&#xA;only son of my mother. I am a child&#xA;grown up on my mother&amp;rsquo;s lap. I am full of&#xA;fear.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But, Brihannala wanted to save him from&#xA;himself, and would not let him go. He&#xA;pursued him, seized him and dragged him&#xA;to the chariot by force.&#xA;Uttara began to sob and said: &amp;ldquo;What a fool&#xA;I was to brag! Alas! What will happen to&#xA;me?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna said kindly, soothing the prince&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;fears: &amp;ldquo;Be not afraid. I shall fight with the&#xA;Kauravas. Help me by looking after the&#xA;horses and driving the chariot, and I shall&#xA;do the rest. Believe me, no good ever&#xA;came of flight. We will rout the enemy&#xA;and recover your cows. You will have all&#xA;the glory.&amp;rdquo; With these words Arjuna lifted&#xA;the prince on to the chariot and, putting&#xA;the reins in his hands, asked him to drive&#xA;towards a tree near the burial ground.&#xA;Drona, who was watching all this intently,&#xA;knew that the fantastically dressed&#xA;charioteer was Arjuna and shared his&#xA;knowledge with Bhishma.&#xA;Duryodhana turned to Karna and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why should we worry who he is? Even if&#xA;he is Arjuna, he will be only playing into&#xA;our hands, for his being discovered will&#xA;send the Pandavas to the forest for another&#xA;twelve years.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As soon as they came near the tree&#xA;Brihannala bade the prince get down,&#xA;climb the tree and take down the arms&#xA;hidden there. The prince said in alarm and&#xA;grief: &amp;ldquo;People say that what hangs on this&#xA;tree is the corpse of an old huntress. How&#xA;can I touch a dead body? How can you&#xA;ask me to do such a thing?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna said: &amp;ldquo;It is not a corpse, prince. I&#xA;know that it contains the weapons of the&#xA;Pandavas. Climb up the tree bravely and&#xA;bring them down. Do not delay.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Seeing that resistance was of no avail&#xA;Uttara climbed up the tree as Brihannala&#xA;had asked him to and took, in great&#xA;disgust, the bag tied up there and came&#xA;down.&#xA;When the leather bag was opened, he saw&#xA;weapons as bright as the sun. Uttara stood&#xA;amazed at the sight of the gleaming&#xA;weapons and covered his eyes.&#xA;He mustered courage and touched them.&#xA;The touch seemed to send a stream of&#xA;hope and high courage into him. He asked&#xA;with ardor: &amp;ldquo;O charioteer, what a wonder!&#xA;You say that these bows, arrows and&#xA;swords belong to the Pandavas. They have&#xA;been deprived of their kingdom and they&#xA;have retired to the forest. Do you know&#xA;them? Where are they?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Arjuna told him briefly how they&#xA;were all in Virata&amp;rsquo;s court. He said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Kanka, who serves the king, is&#xA;Yudhishthira. Valala, the cook who&#xA;prepares such nice dishes for your father,&#xA;is none other than Bhima. Sairandhri, for&#xA;insulting whom Kichaka was killed, is&#xA;Draupadi. Dharmagranthi, who looks after&#xA;the horses and Tantripala, the keeper of&#xA;the cows, are Nakula and Sahadeva&#xA;respectively. I am Arjuna. Be not afraid.&#xA;O prince, you will soon see me defeat the&#xA;Kauravas even in the sight of Bhishma,&#xA;Drona and Aswatthama and recover the&#xA;cows. You will also gain renown and it&#xA;will be a lesson to you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Uttara folded his hands and said: &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;Arjuna, how fortunate I am to see you&#xA;with my own eyes! So, Arjuna is the&#xA;victorious hero whose very contact has&#xA;put heart and courage into me. Forgive the&#xA;wrongs I have done through ignorance.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As they approached the Kaurava host,&#xA;Arjuna recounted some of his heroic&#xA;deeds, so that Uttara might not lose grip of&#xA;his newly awakened courage. Arriving infront of the Kauravas, he got down,&#xA;prayed to God, removed the conch-&#xA;bangles from his hands and put on leather&#xA;gauntlets.&#xA;He then tied a cloth on his flowing hair,&#xA;stood facing the east, meditated on his&#xA;armor, got into the chariot and gloried in&#xA;the familiar feel of his famous Gandiva&#xA;bow. He stringed it and thrice twanged the&#xA;string whose shrill note raised an echo&#xA;from all sides.&#xA;Hearing the sound, the heroes of the&#xA;Kaurava army said to one another: &amp;ldquo;This&#xA;surely is Gandiva&amp;rsquo;s voice.&amp;rdquo; When Arjuna&#xA;stood on the chariot in all his godlike&#xA;stature and blew his conch Devadatta, the&#xA;Kaurava army was alarmed and a frenzied&#xA;shout arose that the Pandavas had come.&#xA;The story of Uttara, who spoke boastfully&#xA;in the ladies&amp;rsquo; boudoirs and fled in panic at&#xA;the sight of the hostile array, his not been&#xA;introduced in the Mahabharata, merely as&#xA;a comic interlude.&#xA;It is in ordinary human nature to look with&#xA;contempt on lower levels of conduct in&#xA;ability. The rich scorn the poor, the&#xA;beautiful scorn the plain, and the strong&#xA;scorn the weak. Brave men despise&#xA;cowards. But Arjuna was no ordinary&#xA;man. He was a great soul and a true hero&#xA;who felt that his duty as a strong, brave&#xA;man was to help others to rise above their&#xA;weakness.&#xA;Knowing that nature had endowed him&#xA;with courage and bravery at birth, and that&#xA;he owed them to no special exertions on&#xA;his part, he had the true humility of the&#xA;really great. And he did what he could to&#xA;put courage into Uttara and make him&#xA;worthy of his lineage. This was Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;characteristic nobility. He never abused&#xA;his strength and power. One of his many&#xA;names is Bibhatsu, which means one who&#xA;shrank from doing an unworthy act, and&#xA;he lived up to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE chariot of Arjuna thundered on its&#xA;way, seeming to shake the earth. The&#xA;hearts of the Kauravas quaked when they&#xA;heard the twang of the Gandiva bow.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Our army must be arrayed well and with&#xA;care. Arjuna, has come,&amp;rdquo; said Drona&#xA;anxiously. Duryodhana did not at all like&#xA;the honor Drona did Arjuna by this&#xA;anxiety.&#xA;He said to Karna: &amp;ldquo;The Pandavas&amp;rsquo; pledge&#xA;was that they would spend twelve years in&#xA;the forest and the following year&#xA;undiscovered. The thirteenth year has not&#xA;ended yet. Arjuna has revealed himself&#xA;before the time. Why then should we give&#xA;way to fear? The Pandavas will have to go&#xA;again to the forest for another twelve&#xA;years. Drona is suffering from the cold&#xA;feet of the too learned. Let us leave him in&#xA;the rear and advance to the battle.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Karna assented and said: &amp;ldquo;Our soldiers&#39;&#xA;heart is not in the fight and they are&#xA;trembling with fear. They say that the&#xA;man, who stands so proudly, bow in hand,&#xA;on the chariot, speeding towards us, is&#xA;Arjuna. But why need we fear even if it&#xA;were Parasurama? I will myself stop the&#xA;advancing warrior and redeem my word to&#xA;you, and fight him, aye, even if all the&#xA;others stand back. They may drive away&#xA;the cows of the Matsya king while, single&#xA;handed, I shall give them cover, engaging&#xA;Arjuna in battle,&amp;rdquo; and Karna, as usual,&#xA;began to blow his own trumpet.&#xA;When Kripa heard these words of Karna,&#xA;he said: &amp;ldquo;This is pure tomfoolery. We&#xA;must all make a combined attack on&#xA;Arjuna. That would be our one chance of&#xA;success. Do not therefore, brag about your&#xA;opposing him alone and unaided.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Karna grew angry. He said: &amp;ldquo;The acharya&#xA;ever delights in singing Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s praises&#xA;and in magnifying his prowess. Whether&#xA;he does so from fear or excessive&#xA;fondness for the Pandavas, I do not know.&#xA;Those, who are afraid, need not fight, butmay simply look on, while others, who are&#xA;true to the salt they have eaten, engage in&#xA;battle. I, for one, a mere soldier who loves&#xA;my friends and hates my enemies, will&#xA;stand here and fight. What business have&#xA;men learned in the Vedas, who love and&#xA;praise their enemies, got here?&amp;rdquo; said he&#xA;sneeringly.&#xA;Aswatthama, Drona&amp;rsquo;s son and Kripa&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;nephew, could not hear unmoved this&#xA;sneer at the venerable teachers. He said&#xA;sternly to Karna: &amp;ldquo;We have not yet taken&#xA;the king back to Hastinapura, and the&#xA;battle is yet to be won. Your brag is idle&#xA;vainglory. It may be that we are not&#xA;kshatriyas and that we belong to the class&#xA;that recites the Vedas and the sastras. But&#xA;I have not been able to find in any sastra&#xA;that it is honor able for kings to seize&#xA;kingdoms by cheating at dice. Even those,&#xA;who fight and conquer kingdoms, do not&#xA;crow too loudly about it. And I cannot see&#xA;what you have done to be proud of. The&#xA;fire is silent and yet cooks the food. The&#xA;sun shines but not on him. Likewise,&#xA;Mother earth sustains all things, movable&#xA;and immovable, and supports her burden&#xA;without so much as a whisper. What claim&#xA;to praise has a kshatriya who has&#xA;unlawfully seized another&amp;rsquo;s kingdom at a&#xA;game of dice? To have cheated the&#xA;Pandavas of their kingdom is no more a&#xA;matter of glory than to have spread traps&#xA;for unsuspecting birds. O Duryodhana, O&#xA;Karna, in what battle did your heroes&#xA;defeat the Pandavas? You dragged&#xA;Draupadi to the assembly. Are you proud&#xA;of it? You have destroyed the Kaurava&#xA;race like an empty-headed clod that fells a&#xA;big sandal tree for love of its fragrance. A&#xA;fight with Arjuna, you will find, is a very&#xA;different thing from a throw of the dice.&#xA;The Gandiva will send forth sharp arrows&#xA;and not fours and twos as in the game of&#xA;dice. Vain fools, do you think that Sakuni&#xA;can, by mere cheating, sneak a victory in&#xA;battle for you?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The leaders of the Kaurava army lost their&#xA;patience and began a loud wordy warfare.&#xA;Seeing this, the grandsire was filled with&#xA;sorrow and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The wise man does not insult his&#xA;teachers. One should engage in battle only&#xA;after a careful calculation of time, place&#xA;and circumstance. Even wise people often&#xA;lose their balance and good sense over&#xA;their own affairs. Ruffled by anger, even&#xA;the usually so sensible Duryodhana fails&#xA;to recognise that the warrior who stands&#xA;braving our army is Arjuna. His intellect&#xA;has been clouded by anger. O&#xA;Aswatthama, pray do not mind Karna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;offensive remarks. You must take them as&#xA;intended merely to put the preceptors on&#xA;their best spirit and sting them n i to action.&#xA;This is not the time to nurse enmity or&#xA;sow dissension. Drona, Kripa and&#xA;Aswatthama should forget and forgive.&#xA;Where can the Kauravas find in the whole&#xA;world, heroes superior to Drona, the&#xA;preceptor, and his son Aswatthama, who&#xA;combine in themselves Vedic scholarship&#xA;and kshatriya heroism? We know of none&#xA;other than Parasurama who can equal&#xA;Drona. We can conquer Arjuna only if we&#xA;all join together and fight him. Let us&#xA;address ourselves to the task before us. If&#xA;we quarrel amongst ourselves we cannot&#xA;fight Arjuna.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus spoke the grandsire. Soothed by his&#xA;noble words, angry feelings subsided.&#xA;Bhishma turned to Duryodhana and&#xA;continued:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Best of kings, Arjuna has come. The&#xA;stipulated period of thirteen years&#xA;terminated yesterday. Your calculation is&#xA;wrong, as men learned in the science of&#xA;planetary movements will tell you. I knew&#xA;that the period had ended when Arjuna&#xA;blew his conch. Reflect a little before&#xA;deciding on war. If you wish to makepeace with the Pandavas, now is the time&#xA;for it. What do you seek, a just and&#xA;honorable peace or a mutually destructive&#xA;war? Ponder well and make your choice.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana replied: &amp;ldquo;Revered sire, I have&#xA;no wish for peace. I shall not give even a&#xA;village to the Pandavas. Let us get ready&#xA;for war.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Drona said: &amp;ldquo;Let prince Duryodhana&#xA;take away a fourth of the army to guard&#xA;him and return to Hastinapura. Let another&#xA;surround the cows and seize them. If we&#xA;return without seizing the cows it would&#xA;amount to an acknowledgment of defeat.&#xA;With the rest of the army, the five of us&#xA;will give battle to Arjuna.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Kaurava forces ranged themselves&#xA;accordingly in battle array. Arjuna said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Uttara, I do not see Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot or Duryodhana. I see Bhishma&#xA;standing, clad in armor. I think&#xA;Duryodhana is driving away the cows to&#xA;Hastinapura. Let us pursue him and&#xA;recover the cows.&amp;rdquo; With these words&#xA;Arjuna moved away from the Kaurava&#xA;army and went after Duryodhana and the&#xA;cows.&#xA;And as he was going, he respect fully&#xA;greeted his teachers and the old grandsire,&#xA;by drawing his Gandiva bow and sending&#xA;arrows so as to fall near their feet.&#xA;Reverently saluting them in this heroic&#xA;fashion, he left them and pursued&#xA;Duryodhana. Arjuna reached the place&#xA;where the cows were gathered and put to&#xA;rout the marauding forces.&#xA;He then turned to the cowherds and asked&#xA;them to take the cows to the barns, which&#xA;they did with great rejoicing. Arjuna then&#xA;pursued&#xA;Duryodhana.&#xA;Seeing&#xA;this,&#xA;Bhishma and the other Kaurava warriors&#xA;rushed to the rescue and, surrounding&#xA;Arjuna, sent forth arrows against him.&#xA;Arjuna carried on a wonderful fight. First,&#xA;he made at Karna and drove him from the&#xA;battlefield. After that, he attacked and&#xA;defeated Drona. Seeing Drona standing&#xA;spent with fatigue, Aswatthama joined in&#xA;the fight and attacked Arjuna, which gave&#xA;Arjuna an opportunity of letting Drona&#xA;withdraw from the field.&#xA;Then, there ensued a bitter struggle&#xA;between Aswatthama and Arjuna. When&#xA;Aswatthama grew weary, Kripa relieved&#xA;him and maintained the attack against&#xA;Arjuna.&#xA;But Kripa also sustained defeat and the&#xA;whole army was routed and fled in fear.&#xA;Though rallied and brought back to the&#xA;attack by Bhishma, Drona and others,&#xA;there was no fight left in them. Finally,&#xA;they left the field, after a glorious fight&#xA;between Bhishma and Arjuna, which, it is&#xA;said, the gods themselves came to see.&#xA;The attempt to head off Arjuna’s pursuit&#xA;of Duryodhana thus failed and soon&#xA;Arjuna came up with Duryodhana and&#xA;strongly attacked him. Duryodhana was&#xA;defeated and fled from the battlefield, but&#xA;not far, because, when Arjuna taunted him&#xA;with cowardice, he turned round like a&#xA;serpent and resumed the fight.&#xA;Bhishma and others surrounded and&#xA;protected him. Arjuna fought and finally,&#xA;he employed a magic weapon that made&#xA;them all fall down unconscious on the&#xA;battlefield. While they were in that&#xA;condition he snatched away their&#xA;garments. The seizure of the clothes of the&#xA;enemy was the sign of decisive victory in&#xA;those days.&#xA;When Duryodhana came, Bhishma sent&#xA;him back to the city. The whole army&#xA;returned to Hastinapura after this&#xA;humiliating defeat.&#xA;Arjuna said: &amp;ldquo;O Uttara, turn back the&#xA;horses. Our cows have been regained. Our&#xA;enemies have fled. O prince, return to&#xA;your kingdom, adorning your person with&#xA;sandal paste and decked with flowers.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;On the way back, Arjuna deposited the&#xA;weapons as before on the tree and dressedhimself once more as Brihannala. He sent&#xA;messengers in advance to proclaim in the&#xA;city that Uttara had won a glorious&#xA;victory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AFTER defeating Susarma, king of&#xA;Trigarta, Virata returned to his capital&#xA;amidst the acclamations of the citizens.&#xA;When he reached his palace, he saw that&#xA;Uttara was not there and the womenfolk&#xA;told him with much elation that Uttara had&#xA;set out to conquer the Kauravas.&#xA;They had not a doubt that their hand some&#xA;prince could conquer the whole world.&#xA;But the king&amp;rsquo;s heart sank within him at the&#xA;news, for he knew the impossible task&#xA;which the delicately nurtured prince had&#xA;taken on himself with no better following&#xA;than a eunuch.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My dearly loved son must be dead by&#xA;now,&amp;rdquo; he cried, overwhelmed with&#xA;anguish. He then bade his ministers&#xA;collect and send as strong a force as could&#xA;be got together for rescuing Uttara if he&#xA;was still alive and bring him back. Scouts&#xA;also were immediately despatched to find&#xA;out Uttara&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts and fate.&#xA;Dharmaputra, now disguised as the&#xA;sanyasin Kanka, tried to comfort Virata by&#xA;assuring him that the prince could come to&#xA;no harm, since Brihannala had gone as his&#xA;charioteer. &amp;ldquo;You do not know about her,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said he. &amp;ldquo;I do. Whosoever fights from a&#xA;chariot driven by her, can be sure of&#xA;victory. Further, the news of Susarma&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;defeat must have reached there and the&#xA;Kauravas must have retreated.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Meanwhile courtiers arrived from the field&#xA;of battle with the glad news that Uttara&#xA;had defeated the Kaurava forces and&#xA;recovered the kine.&#xA;This seemed too good to be true, even to&#xA;the fond father, but Yudhishthira&#xA;smilingly reassured him. Said he: &amp;ldquo;Have&#xA;no doubts, O king. What the messengers&#xA;say must be true. When Brihannala went&#xA;out as charioteer, success was certain.&#xA;There is nothing extraordinary in your&#xA;son&amp;rsquo;s victory. I happen to know that even&#xA;Indra&amp;rsquo;s charioteer or Krishna&amp;rsquo;s cannot&#xA;equal Brihannala.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This seemed absurd to Virata, but he was&#xA;too happy to resent it. He made large gifts&#xA;of precious stones and other wealth to the&#xA;messengers who brought the good news&#xA;and ordered public rejoicing. &amp;ldquo;My success&#xA;over Susarma is nothing,&amp;rdquo; he proclaimed.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The prince&amp;rsquo;s is the real victory. Let&#xA;special prayers of thanksgiving be offered&#xA;at all places of worship. Let all the&#xA;principal streets are decorated with flags&#xA;and the citizen’s go in procession to&#xA;strains of triumphal music. Make all&#xA;arrangements to receive, in a befitting&#xA;manner, my lion-hearted boy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Virata sent out ministers, soldiers, and&#xA;maidens to welcome his son, returning in&#xA;triumph. When the king retired to his&#xA;private apartments, he asked Sairandhri to&#xA;bring the dice. He said to Kanka: &amp;ldquo;I cannot&#xA;contain my joy. Come, let us play,&amp;rdquo; and&#xA;sat down to a game with Yudhishthira.&#xA;They talked while they played and&#xA;naturally, the king was full of his son&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;greatness and prowess. &amp;ldquo;See the glory of&#xA;my son, Bhuminjaya. He has put the&#xA;famed Kaurava warriors to flight.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; replied Yudhishthira with a smile.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Your son is indeed fortunate for, without&#xA;the best of good fortune, how could he&#xA;have secured Brihannala to drive his&#xA;chariot?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Virata was angry at this persistent&#xA;glorification of Brihannala at the expenses&#xA;of Uttara. &amp;ldquo;Why do you, again and again&#xA;babble about the eunuch?&amp;rdquo; he cried.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;While I am talking about my son&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;victory, you expatiate on the charioteering&#xA;skill of the eunuch, as if that were of any&#xA;significance.&amp;rdquo; The king&amp;rsquo;s anger only&#xA;increased when Kanka remonstrated: &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;know what I am talking about. Brihannalais no ordinary person. The chariot she&#xA;drives can never see defeat, and whoever&#xA;is in it, is sure of success in any&#xA;undertaking, no matter how difficult.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Now, this perverse flouting could not be&#xA;borne, and Virata in a passion flung the&#xA;dice at Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s face and followed&#xA;this up with a blow on Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;cheek. Yudhishthira was hurt and blood&#xA;flowed down his face.&#xA;Sairandhri who was nearby, wiped the&#xA;blood with the edge of her garment and&#xA;squeezed it into a golden cup. &amp;ldquo;Why all&#xA;this fuss? What are you collecting the&#xA;blood into a cup for?&amp;rdquo; demanded the angry&#xA;king, who was still in a passion.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;A Sanyasin&amp;rsquo;s blood may not be split on&#xA;the ground, O king,&amp;rdquo; replied Sairandhri.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The rains will fail in your land for as&#xA;many years as there are drops in the blood&#xA;that is split on the earth. That was why I&#xA;collected the blood in this cup. I fear you&#xA;do not know Kanka&amp;rsquo;s greatness.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Meanwhile the gatekeeper announced:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Uttara and Brihannala have arrived. The&#xA;prince is waiting for an audience with the&#xA;king.&amp;rdquo; Virata got up excitedly and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ask him in, ask him in.&amp;rdquo; And&#xA;Yudhishthira whispered to the sentry: &amp;ldquo;Let&#xA;Uttara come alone. Brihannala should stay&#xA;behind.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He did this to prevent a catastrophe, for he&#xA;knew Arjuna would be unable to control&#xA;his anger when he saw the injury on his&#xA;brother&amp;rsquo;s face. He could not bear to see&#xA;Dharmaputra hurt by anyone except in fair&#xA;battle.&#xA;Uttara entered and paid due homage to his&#xA;royal father. When he turned to do&#xA;obeisance to Kanka be was horrified to&#xA;see his bleeding face, for now he knew&#xA;that Kanka was the great Yudhishthira.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O king,&amp;rdquo; he cried, &amp;ldquo;who was it that&#xA;caused hurt to this great one?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Virata looked at his son and said: &amp;ldquo;Why&#xA;all this fuss about it? I struck him for&#xA;untimely and envious belittling of you&#xA;when I was in an ocean of delight at the&#xA;news of your glorious victory. Each time I&#xA;mentioned you, this unlucky brahmana&#xA;extolled your charioteer, the eunuch, and&#xA;gave the victory to him. It was too silly&#xA;really, and I am sorry I struck him, but it&#xA;is not worth talking about.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Uttara was overwhelmed with fear. &amp;ldquo;Alas!&#xA;You have done great wrong. Fall at his&#xA;feet right now, father, and pray&#xA;forforgiveness or we will be destroyed,&#xA;root and branch.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Virata, to whom all this was inexplicable,&#xA;stood with a puzzled frown not knowing&#xA;what to do. But Uttara was so anxious and&#xA;importunate that he yielded and bowed to&#xA;Yudhishthira asking for pardon.&#xA;Thereafter, embracing his son and making&#xA;him sit, Virata said: &amp;ldquo;My boy, you are&#xA;truly a hero. I am in a fever of impatience&#xA;to hear all about it. How did you defeat&#xA;the Kaurava army? How did you recover&#xA;the kine?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Uttara hung his head down. &amp;ldquo;I conquered&#xA;no army,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;and rescued no cows.&#xA;All that was the work of a god prince. He&#xA;took up our cause, rescued me from&#xA;destruction, put the Kaurava soldiers to&#xA;flight and brought the herd back. I did&#xA;nothing.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The king could hardly believe his ears.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Where is that god prince?&amp;rdquo; he asked. &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;must see and thank the hero who rescued&#xA;my son and beat back my foes. I will give&#xA;my daughter, Uttara, in marriage to him.&#xA;Go and fetch him in.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;He has disappeared for the time being,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;replied the prince, &amp;ldquo;but I think he will&#xA;come again either today or tomorrow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Uttara spoke thus because Arjuna was&#xA;indeed a prince of the gods and had also&#xA;for the time being disappeared in&#xA;Brihannala.&#xA;In Virata&amp;rsquo;s hall of assembly, all the&#xA;leading citizens had gathered to celebratethe king&amp;rsquo;s victory and the prince&amp;rsquo;s. Kanka,&#xA;Valala the cook, Brihannala, Tantripala&#xA;and Dharmagranthi, who were responsible&#xA;for the victories, arrived also and entering&#xA;the hall, to the surprise of everyone, sat&#xA;among the princes unbid.&#xA;Some explained the conduct by saying&#xA;that, after all, these humbler folk had&#xA;rendered invaluable service at a critical&#xA;time and really deserved recognition.&#xA;Virata entered the court. On seeing Kanka&#xA;sanyasin and the cook and the others&#xA;seated in places reserved for princess and&#xA;the nobility the king lost his temper and&#xA;gave loud vent to his displeasure.&#xA;When they felt they had enough fun, the&#xA;Pandavas disclosed their identity to the&#xA;amazement of all present. Virata was&#xA;beside himself with joy to think that it was&#xA;the Pandava princes and Panchali who had&#xA;been ministering to him all these days in&#xA;disguise. He embraced Kanka in&#xA;exuberant gratitude and made a formal&#xA;surrender of his kingdom and his all to&#xA;him, of course immediately receiving&#xA;them back with thanks. Virata also&#xA;insisted that he should give his daughter in&#xA;marriage to Arjuna.&#xA;But Arjuna said: &amp;ldquo;No, that would not be&#xA;proper, for the princess learnt dancing and&#xA;music from me. I, as her teacher, am in&#xA;the position of father to her.&amp;rdquo; He,&#xA;however, agreed to accept her for his son&#xA;Abhimanyu.&#xA;Meanwhile, envoys arrived from the&#xA;wicked and treacherous Duryodhana with&#xA;a message for Yudhishthira. &amp;ldquo;O son of&#xA;Kunti,&amp;rdquo; they said, &amp;ldquo;Duryodhana feels very&#xA;sorry that owing to the hasty action of&#xA;Dhananjaya, you have to go back to the&#xA;woods again. He let himself be recognised&#xA;before the end of the thirteenth year and&#xA;so, in accordance with your undertaking,&#xA;you have to dwell in the forest for another&#xA;twelve years.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dharmaputra&#xA;laughed&#xA;and&#xA;said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Messengers,&#xA;return&#xA;quickly&#xA;to&#xA;Duryodhana and tell him to make further&#xA;inquiry. The venerable Bhishma and&#xA;others learned in the stars will no doubt&#xA;tell him that full thirteen years had been&#xA;completed before your forces heard again&#xA;the twang of Dhananjaya&amp;rsquo;s bow and fled in&#xA;fear.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE thirteenth year during which the&#xA;Pandavas had to remain undiscovered&#xA;came to an end.&#xA;No longer obliged to be in disguise, they&#xA;left Virata&amp;rsquo;s capital as Pandavas and&#xA;settled openly in Upaplavya, another place&#xA;in Matsya territory. From there, they sent&#xA;emissaries to summon their friends and&#xA;relatives.&#xA;From Dwaraka came Balarama and&#xA;Krishna with Arjuna’s wife Subhadra, and&#xA;her son, Abhimanyu and accompanied by&#xA;many Yadava warriors. Loud and long&#xA;was the blare of trumpet-conchs as the&#xA;Matsya prince and the Pandavas went&#xA;forth to receive Janardana.&#xA;Indrasena and many others like him, who&#xA;had at the beginning of the preceding year&#xA;left the Pandavas in the forest, rejoined&#xA;them with their chariots at Upaplavya.&#xA;The Kasi prince and Saibya ruler arrived&#xA;with their forces.&#xA;Drupada, the Panchala prince, was there&#xA;too with three divisions, bringing with&#xA;him Sikhandin and Draupadi&amp;rsquo;s sons and&#xA;her brother Dhrishtadyumna. There were&#xA;many&#xA;other&#xA;princes&#xA;gathered&#xA;at&#xA;Upaplavya, well attached to the Pandavas,&#xA;Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s marriage to princess Uttara&#xA;was solemnized according to Vedic rites&#xA;before that illustrious gathering of friendly&#xA;heroes. The wedding celebrations over,&#xA;they met in conclave in Virata&amp;rsquo;s hall of&#xA;assembly.&#xA;Krishna sat next to Yudhishthira and&#xA;Virata, while Balarama and Satyaki wereseated beside Drupada. As the bustle died&#xA;down, all eyes were turned on Krishna,&#xA;who now rose to speak.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You all know,&amp;rdquo; said Krishna to the&#xA;hushed assembly, &amp;ldquo;the story of the great&#xA;deceit how Yudhishthira was cheated at&#xA;the game board and deprived of his&#xA;kingdom and exiled with his brothers and&#xA;Draupadi to the forest. For thirteen years,&#xA;the sons of Pandu have patiently borne&#xA;their trouble in redemption of their&#xA;pledged word. Ponder well and counsel a&#xA;course, which will be in consonance with&#xA;dharma and contribute to the glory and&#xA;welfare of both Pandavas and Kauravas.&#xA;For, Dharmaputra desires nothing that he&#xA;cannot justly claim. He wishes nothing but&#xA;good even to the sons of Dhritarashtra&#xA;who deceived him and did him grievous&#xA;wrong. In giving your counsel, bear in&#xA;mind the fraud and meanness of the&#xA;Kauravas as well as the honorable&#xA;magnanimity of the Pandavas. Devise a&#xA;just and honorable settlement. We do not&#xA;know what Duryodhana has in his mind. I&#xA;feel we should send an able and upright&#xA;emissary to him to persuade him to a&#xA;peaceful settlement by the restoration of&#xA;half the kingdom to Yudhishthira.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Balarama then rose to address the&#xA;gathering. &amp;ldquo;You have just heard Krishna,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he said. &amp;ldquo;The solution he propounds is&#xA;wise and just. I endorse it as good for both&#xA;Duryodhana and Dharmaputra. If Kunti&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;sons can get back their kingdom by a&#xA;peaceful settlement, nothing could be&#xA;better for them, the Kauravas and for all&#xA;concerned. Only then will there be&#xA;happiness and peace in the land. Someone&#xA;has to go to convey to Duryodhana&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s wish for a peaceful&#xA;settlement and bring an answer from him,&#xA;a man who has the weight and the ability&#xA;to bring about peace and good&#xA;understanding. The envoy should get the&#xA;cooperation of Bhishma, Dhritarashtra,&#xA;Drona and Vidura, Kripa and Aswatthama&#xA;and even of Karna and Sakuni if possible,&#xA;and secure support for Kunti&amp;rsquo;s sons. He&#xA;should be one who, on no account, would&#xA;give way to anger. Dharmaputra, with full&#xA;knowledge of consequences, staked his&#xA;kingdom&#xA;and&#xA;lost&#xA;it,&#xA;obstinately&#xA;disregarding the reasoning of friends.&#xA;Fully aware that he was no match for the&#xA;adept Sakuni, he yet played against him.&#xA;He cannot now complain but can only&#xA;supplicate for his rights. A fit envoy&#xA;would be one who is not a warmonger but&#xA;is dead set, in spite of every difficulty, on&#xA;achieving a peaceful settlement. Princes, I&#xA;desire you to approach Duryodhana&#xA;tactfully and make peace with him. Let us&#xA;avoid an armed conflict by all the means&#xA;in our power. Only that which accrues in&#xA;peace is worth while. Out of war, nothing&#xA;but wrong can issue.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Balarama&amp;rsquo;s position was that Yudhishthira&#xA;knew what he was doing when he&#xA;gambled away his kingdom and could not&#xA;now claim it as of right.&#xA;The fulfilment of the conditions of exile&#xA;could only give the Pandavas their&#xA;personal freedom and not their kingdom,&#xA;that is to say, they need not serve another&#xA;term of exile in the forest. But it gave&#xA;them no right to the return of their&#xA;kingdom.&#xA;Dharmaputra could only supplicate for the&#xA;return of what he had lost and not claim it&#xA;as of right. Balarama did not relish an&#xA;armed conflict among scions of the same&#xA;family and rightly held that war would&#xA;lead only to disaster.&#xA;The poet puts an eternal truth in&#xA;Balarama&amp;rsquo;s mouth.&#xA;Satyaki, the Yadava warrior, who heard&#xA;Balarama speak thus, could not contain&#xA;himself. He rose in anger and spoke&#xA;indignantly:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Balarama&amp;rsquo;s words do not strike me as in&#xA;the least degree just. One can, if skilfulenough, make out a plausible plea for any&#xA;case, but not all the skill in the world can&#xA;convert wrong into right or injustice into&#xA;justice. I must protest against Balarama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;stand, which fills me with disgust. Do we&#xA;not see in one and the same tree, one&#xA;branch bowed with fruit and another&#xA;sticking out gaunt and useless? So, of&#xA;these brothers, Krishna speaks words that&#xA;breathe the spirit of dharma while&#xA;Balarama&amp;rsquo;s attitude is unworthy. And if&#xA;you grant what cannot be doubted that the&#xA;Kauravas cheated Yudhishthira of his&#xA;share of the kingdom, why then, allowing&#xA;them to keep it is as unjust as confirming&#xA;a thief in the possession of his booty!&#xA;Anyone,&#xA;who&#xA;finds&#xA;fault&#xA;with&#xA;Dharmaputra, does so in cowardly fear of&#xA;Duryodhana, not for any sound reason. O&#xA;princes, forgive my harsh speech. Not of&#xA;his own volition but because the Kauravas&#xA;pressed and invited him to do so, did the&#xA;novice and unwilling Dharmaputra play&#xA;with a dishonest gambler that game so&#xA;fraught with disaster. Why should he bow&#xA;and supplicate before Duryodhana, now&#xA;that he has fulfilled his pledges?&#xA;Yudhishthira is not a mendicant and need&#xA;not beg. He has kept his word and so have&#xA;his brothers twelve years in exile in the&#xA;forest and twelve months there after in&#xA;disguise according to their pledge. And&#xA;yet, Duryodhana and his associates, most&#xA;shamelessly and dishonestly, question the&#xA;performance. I shall defeat these impudent&#xA;villains in battle and they shall either seek&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s pardon or meet their doom.&#xA;How can a righteous war be wrong in any&#xA;case? There is no sin in slaying enemies&#xA;who take up arms and fight. To supplicate&#xA;before the enemy, is to incur disgrace. If&#xA;Duryodhana desires war, he can have it&#xA;and we shall be quite ready for it. Let&#xA;there be no delay and let us get on with&#xA;the preparations. Duryodhana is not going&#xA;to part with territory without a war and it&#xA;would be folly to waste time.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Drupada&amp;rsquo;s heart was gladdened by&#xA;Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s resolute words. He rose and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Satyaki is right and I support him. Soft&#xA;words will not bring Duryodhana round to&#xA;reason. Let us continue our preparations&#xA;for war and let our friends be warned&#xA;without loss of time to bring up their&#xA;forces. Send word instantly to Salya,&#xA;Dhrishtaketu, Jayatsena and Kekaya. We&#xA;must, of course, send a suitable envoy to&#xA;Dhritarashtra. The learned brahmana, who&#xA;conducts the religious ceremonies in my&#xA;court, can be sent to Hastinapura, with&#xA;confidence. Instruct him well as to what&#xA;he should say to Duryodhana and how he&#xA;should convey the message to Bhishma,&#xA;Dhritarashtra and Dronacharya.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Drupada concluded, Vasudeva&#xA;(Krishna, the son of Vasudeva) rose and&#xA;addressing Drupada, said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What you suggest is practicable and also&#xA;conforms to the kingly code. Baladeva&#xA;and I are bound to the Kauravas and the&#xA;Pandavas with equal ties of affection. We&#xA;came here for princess Uttara&amp;rsquo;s wedding&#xA;and will return now to our city. Great are&#xA;you among the princes of the land, alike in&#xA;age and wisdom, and entitled to advise us&#xA;all. Dhritarashtra too holds you, his&#xA;boyhood friends, in high esteem like&#xA;Drona and Kripa. It is therefore only right&#xA;that you should instruct the brahmana&#xA;envoy on his mission of peace. If he fails&#xA;to persuade Duryodhana out of his error,&#xA;prepare for the inevitable conflict, my&#xA;friends, and send word to us.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The conference ended and Krishna left for&#xA;Dwaraka with his people. The Pandavas&#xA;and their allies went on with their&#xA;preparations. Messengers went forth to all&#xA;the friendly princes who got busy and&#xA;mobilised their respective armies.&#xA;Meanwhile, Duryodhana and his brothers&#xA;were not idle. They also began preparingfor the coming conflict and sent word to&#xA;their friends to get their contingents ready&#xA;for war.&#xA;News of these preparations on both sides&#xA;soon spread through out the land. &amp;ldquo;The&#xA;constant rapid journeying back and forth&#xA;of princes caused a great stir everywhere.&#xA;The earth shook beneath the heavy tramp&#xA;of marching legions,&amp;rdquo; says the poet.&#xA;It would appear that even in olden days,&#xA;military preparations were made in much&#xA;the same way as in our times.&#xA;Drupada called in his brahmana and said&#xA;to him: &amp;ldquo;You know Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s bent of&#xA;mind as well as the qualities of the&#xA;Pandavas. Go to him as the emissary of&#xA;the Pandavas. The Kauravas deceived the&#xA;Pandavas with the connivance of their&#xA;father Dhritarashtra who would not listen&#xA;to the sage advice of Vidura. Show the&#xA;old, weak king, who is misled by his son,&#xA;the path of dharma and wisdom. You will&#xA;find in Vidura a great ally in this task.&#xA;Your mission may lead to differences of&#xA;opinion among the elder statesmen such&#xA;as Bhishma, Drona and Kripa as well as&#xA;among the warlords. And, if this happens,&#xA;it will be some time before those&#xA;differences are smoothed out, which will&#xA;be time gained for the completion of the&#xA;Pandavas war preparations. As long as&#xA;you are in Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s capital talking of&#xA;peace, their preparations for war will&#xA;receive a set-back which is all to the good&#xA;from the Pandavas&amp;rsquo; standpoint. If, by a&#xA;miracle, you are able to come back with&#xA;good terms of peace, so much the better. I&#xA;do not expect Duryodhana will agree to a&#xA;peaceful settlement. Still, to send one on a&#xA;peace mission will be advantageous to&#xA;us.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In December 1941, the Japanese were&#xA;carrying on negotiations with the&#xA;Americans and, immediately on the&#xA;breakdown of those talks, took them&#xA;unawares and attacked Pearl Harbor&#xA;destroying their naval forces there.&#xA;Drupada&amp;rsquo;s instruction to the brahmana&#xA;would show that this was no new&#xA;technique. And that, even in the old days,&#xA;the same method was followed of carrying&#xA;on negotiations and even sincerely&#xA;working for peace, but simultaneously&#xA;preparing, with unremitting vigor, for&#xA;outbreak of war and carrying on peace&#xA;talks with the object of creating dissension&#xA;in the enemy&amp;rsquo;s ranks. There is nothing&#xA;new under the sun!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HAVING sent Drupada&amp;rsquo;s brahmana to&#xA;Hastinapura on the peace mission, the&#xA;Pandavas sent word, at the same time, to&#xA;the princes likely to favor their cause to&#xA;collect their forces and hold themselves in&#xA;readiness for war. To Dwaraka, Arjuna&#xA;went himself.&#xA;Having understood through his spies the&#xA;turn events were taking, Duryodhana too&#xA;did not remain idle. Learning that&#xA;Vasudeva (Krishna) was back in his home&#xA;city, he sped towards Dwaraka in his&#xA;chariot, as fast as his swiftest horses could&#xA;take him. The two of them, Arjuna and&#xA;Duryodhana, thus reached Dwaraka on the&#xA;same day.&#xA;Krishna was fast asleep. Because they&#xA;were his close relatives, Arjuna and&#xA;Duryodhana could go into his bedroom.&#xA;There they both waited for Krishna to&#xA;wake up. Duryodhana, who went in first,&#xA;seated himself on a decorated throne-chair&#xA;at the head of the bed, while Arjuna kept&#xA;standing at its foot with arms folded in&#xA;respectful posture.&#xA;When Mahadeva woke up, his eyes fell on&#xA;Arjuna who stood in front of him and he&#xA;gave him warm welcome. Turning then to&#xA;Duryodhana, he welcomed him too and&#xA;asked them what brought them both to&#xA;Dwaraka. Duryodhana was the first to&#xA;speak.&amp;ldquo;It looks,&amp;rdquo; said he, &amp;ldquo;as though war would&#xA;break out between us soon. If it does, you&#xA;must support me. Arjuna and I are equally&#xA;beloved of you. We both claim equally&#xA;close relationship with you. You cannot&#xA;say that either of us is nearer to you than&#xA;the other. I came here before Arjuna.&#xA;Tradition has it that he who came first&#xA;should be shown preference. Janardana,&#xA;you are the greatest among the great; so it&#xA;is incumbent on you to set an example to&#xA;others. Confirm with your conduct the&#xA;traditional dharma and remember that it&#xA;was I who came first.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;To&#xA;which&#xA;Purushottama&#xA;(Krishna)&#xA;answered: &amp;ldquo;Son of Dhritarashtra, it may be&#xA;that you came here first, but it was Kunti&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;son that I saw immediately on waking up.&#xA;If you were the first arrival, it was Arjuna&#xA;who first caught my eye. So, even in this&#xA;respect, your claims on me are equal and I&#xA;am therefore bound to render assistance to&#xA;both sides. In distributing favors, the&#xA;traditional usage is to begin with the&#xA;junior-most among the recipients. I would,&#xA;therefore, offer the choice to Arjuna first.&#xA;The Narayana, my tribesmen, are my&#xA;equals in battle and constitute a host, large&#xA;and almost invincible. In my distribution&#xA;of assistance, they will be on one side, and&#xA;I individually on the other. But I shall&#xA;wield no weapon and take no part in&#xA;actual fighting.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Turning to Arjuna he said, &amp;ldquo;Partha, think&#xA;it over well. Would you want me, alone&#xA;and weaponless, or would you prefer the&#xA;prowess of the Narayana? Exercise the&#xA;right to the first choice which custom&#xA;gives you as the younger man.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Scarcely had Krishna finished when&#xA;Arjuna said with reverence and without&#xA;hesitation: &amp;ldquo;I would be content if you are&#xA;with us, though you may wield no&#xA;weapon.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana could hardly contain himself&#xA;for joy at what he thought was Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;imbecile choice. He gladly chose the help&#xA;of Vasudevas army and his request was&#xA;granted. Pleased with the acquisition of a&#xA;mighty force, Duryodhana went to&#xA;Baladeva and told him the story.&#xA;As he finished speaking, the mighty&#xA;Balarama said: &amp;ldquo;Duryodhana, they must&#xA;have told you all I said at the time of the&#xA;marriage of Virata&amp;rsquo;s daughter. I pleaded&#xA;your case and urged everything that could&#xA;be said for you. Often have I told Krishna&#xA;that we have equal ties with the Kauravas&#xA;and the Pandavas. But my words failed to&#xA;carry conviction to him. I am helpless. It&#xA;is impossible for me to side with one&#xA;whom Krishna opposes. I will not help&#xA;Partha and I cannot support you against&#xA;Krishna. Duryodhana, you come of an&#xA;illustrious line, which is respected by all&#xA;the princes of the land. Well, then, if it&#xA;must be war, bear yourself in accordance&#xA;with the Kshatriya code,&amp;rdquo; said he.&#xA;Duryodhana returned to Hastinapura in&#xA;high spirits saying to himself: &amp;ldquo;Arjuna has&#xA;made a fool of himself. The great army of&#xA;Dwaraka will fight on my side and&#xA;Balarama&amp;rsquo;s good wishes too are with me.&#xA;Vasudeva has been left without an army.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dhananjaya, why did you choose thus&#xA;unwisely, preferring me alone and&#xA;unarmed to my fully equipped and heroic&#xA;forces?&amp;rdquo; asked Krishna of Arjuna with a&#xA;smile, when they were alone. Arjuna&#xA;answered:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My ambition is to achieve glory even like&#xA;yours. You have the power and prowess to&#xA;face all the princes of the land and their&#xA;hordes in battle single-handed. I too feel I&#xA;can do it. So, I desire that I should win the&#xA;battle with you driving my chariot&#xA;unarmed. I have desired this for long and&#xA;you have today fulfilled my wish.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vasudeva smiled again and pronounced&#xA;this benediction: &amp;ldquo;Are you trying to&#xA;compete with me? May you succeed,&amp;rdquo; for&#xA;he was pleased with Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s decision.This is the sacred story of how Krishna&#xA;became Partha&amp;rsquo;s charioteer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>051 SALYA AGAINST HIS NEPHEWS</title>

      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/mahAbhAratam/kAvyam/bhAShAntaram/en/rAjagopAlAchAri/051_SALYA_AGAINST_HIS_NEPHEWS/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SALYA, the ruler of Madradesa, was the&#xA;brother of Madri, the mother of Nakula&#xA;and Sahadeva. He heard that the Pandavas&#xA;were camping in the city of Upaplavya&#xA;and making preparations for war.&#xA;He collected a very big army and set off&#xA;towards that city to join the Pandavas.&#xA;Salya&amp;rsquo;s army was so large that where it&#xA;halted for rest, the encampment extended&#xA;over a length of nearly fifteen miles.&#xA;News of Salya and his marching forces&#xA;reached Duryodhana. Deciding that Salya&#xA;should somehow be persuaded to join his&#xA;side, Duryodhana instructed his officers to&#xA;provide him and his great army with all&#xA;facilities and treat them to sumptuous&#xA;hospitality.&#xA;In&#xA;accordance&#xA;with&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;instruction, several beautifully decorated&#xA;rest houses were erected at several places&#xA;on the route, at which Salya and his men&#xA;were treated to wondrous hospitality.&#xA;Food and drink were lavishly provided.&#xA;Salya was exceedingly pleased with the&#xA;attentions paid to him but assumed that his&#xA;nephew, Yudhishthira, had arranged all&#xA;this. Salya&amp;rsquo;s army marched on, the earth&#xA;shaking beneath their heavy strides.&#xA;Feeling very pleased with the hospitality,&#xA;he called the waiting attendants one day&#xA;and said to them:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I must reward you all who have treated&#xA;me and my soldiers with so much love&#xA;and attention. Please tell Kunti&amp;rsquo;s son that&#xA;he should let me do this, and bring me his&#xA;consent.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The servants went and told their master,&#xA;Duryodhana, this. Duryodhana, who was&#xA;all the time moving unobserved with the&#xA;party waiting on Salya and his soldiers, at&#xA;once took this opportunity to present&#xA;himself before Salya, and say how&#xA;honored he felt at Salya&amp;rsquo;s acceptance of&#xA;the Kaurava hospitality.&#xA;This amazed Salya whom till then had no&#xA;suspicion of the truth, and he was also&#xA;touched by the chivalry of Duryodhana in&#xA;lavishing kingly hospitality on a partisan&#xA;of the Pandavas.&#xA;Greatly moved, he exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;How noble&#xA;and kind of you! How can I repay you?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana replied: &amp;ldquo;You and your forces&#xA;should fight on my side. This is the&#xA;reward I ask of you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Salya was stunned.&#xA;The Puranas wherein right conduct is&#xA;always preached, sometimes set out&#xA;stories in which conduct, not in&#xA;conformity&#xA;with&#xA;Dharma,&#xA;seems&#xA;condoned. Is it right, one may ask, for&#xA;religious books thus to seem to justify&#xA;wrong?&#xA;A little reflection will enable one to see&#xA;the matter in proper light. It is necessary&#xA;to bring home the fact that even wise,&#xA;good and great men are liable to fall into&#xA;error.&#xA;That is why the Puranas, although ever&#xA;seeking to instil Dharma, contain&#xA;narratives to show how in this world even&#xA;good people sometimes sin against&#xA;Dharma, as though irresistibly driven to&#xA;do so.&#xA;This is to press home the truth that&#xA;howsoever learned one may be, humility&#xA;and constant vigilance are absolutely&#xA;necessary if one wishes to avoid evil.&#xA;Why indeed, did the great authors of our&#xA;epics write about the lapses of Rama in&#xA;the Ramayana and Yudhishthira in the&#xA;Mahabharata?&#xA;Where was the need to make mention of&#xA;them and then labor arguments to explain&#xA;them away, thereby disturbing men&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;minds?&#xA;It was not as though others had discovered&#xA;the lapses and Vyasa and Valmiki had to&#xA;defend their heroes. The stories are artisticcreations in which lapses they impress the&#xA;desired moral.&#xA;The parts dealing with the lapses deeply&#xA;distress the reader&amp;rsquo;s mind and serve as&#xA;solemn warnings of pitfalls, which wait to&#xA;engulf the careless.&#xA;They dispose the mind to humility and&#xA;watchfulness and make it realise the need&#xA;for divine guidance. The modern cinema&#xA;also projects on the screen much that is&#xA;bad and immoral.&#xA;Whatever may be the explanation offered&#xA;by the protagonists of the cinema, evil is&#xA;presented on the screen in an attractive&#xA;fashion that grips people&amp;rsquo;s minds and&#xA;tempts them into the path of wickedness.&#xA;This is not so in the Puranas. Although&#xA;they do point out that even great men now&#xA;and again fell into error and committed&#xA;wrong, the presentation is such as to warn&#xA;the reader and not to allure him into evil&#xA;ways.&#xA;This is the striking difference between our&#xA;epics and the modern talkies, which arises&#xA;from the difference in the character of the&#xA;people who produced them.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are the same unto us both. I must&#xA;mean as much to you as the Pandavas.&#xA;You must agree to come to my aid,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Duryodhana.&#xA;Salya answered: &amp;ldquo;Be it so.&amp;rdquo; Flattered by&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s splendid reception, Salya&#xA;deserted the Pandavas who were entitled&#xA;to his love and esteem and pledged his&#xA;word to fight on Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s side which&#xA;shows what dangers may lurk in receiving&#xA;the hospitality of kings.&#xA;Feeling that it would not be right to go&#xA;back without meeting Yudhishthira, Salya&#xA;then turned to Duryodhana saying:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Duryodhana, believe me. I have given&#xA;you my word of honor. I must however&#xA;meet Yudhishthira and tell him what I&#xA;have done.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Go, see him and return soon. And do not&#xA;forget your promise to me,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Duryodhana.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Good luck to you. Go back to your&#xA;palace. I will not betray you.&amp;rdquo; Saying this,&#xA;Salya went to the city of Upaplavya where&#xA;Yudhishthira was camping.&#xA;The Pandavas received the ruler of Madra&#xA;with great eclat. Nakula and Sahadeva&#xA;were joyous beyond measure to see their&#xA;uncle to whom the Pandavas narrated all&#xA;their hardships and sufferings.&#xA;When they started talking about obtaining&#xA;his help in the war that was impending,&#xA;Salya related to them the story of his&#xA;promise to Duryodhana.&#xA;Yudhishthira saw at once that it had been&#xA;a mistake to take Salya&amp;rsquo;s assistance for&#xA;granted, thereby letting Duryodhana&#xA;forestall them.&#xA;Concealing his disappointment as best he&#xA;could, Yudhishthira addressed Salya thus:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Great warrior, you are bound to keep the&#xA;promise you have made to, Duryodhana.&#xA;You are the equal of Vasudeva in battle&#xA;and Karna will have you as his charioteer&#xA;when he seeks Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s life in the&#xA;battlefield. Are you going to be the cause&#xA;of Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s death? Or are you going to&#xA;save him then? I know I cannot fairly ask&#xA;this of you. Still I do.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;To which Salya rejoined: &amp;ldquo;My lad, I have&#xA;been tricked into giving Duryodhana my&#xA;word and I shall be ranged against you in&#xA;battle. But when Karna proceeds to attack&#xA;Arjuna, if I happen to be his charioteer,&#xA;you may take it he will go to battle&#xA;disheartened and Arjuna shall be saved.&#xA;Fear not. The sorrows and insults, which&#xA;were visited on Draupadi and you all, will&#xA;soon be an avenged memory. Henceforth,&#xA;yours will be good luck. No one can&#xA;prevent or alter what has been ordained by&#xA;fate. I have acted wrongly. Bear with me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INDRA, the Lord of the three regions,&#xA;was once so drunk with pride that he quite&#xA;forgot the courteous manners and forms&#xA;that the gods had hitherto observed.&#xA;When Brihaspati, preceptor of the gods,&#xA;foremost in all branches of learning, and&#xA;venerated alike by the gods and the&#xA;asuras, came to his court, Indra did not&#xA;rise from his seat to receive the acharya or&#xA;ask him to be seated and failed to do the&#xA;customary honors.&#xA;In his great conceit, Indra persuaded&#xA;himself to believe that the sastras allowed&#xA;him as a king in court the prerogative of&#xA;receiving guests seated. Brihaspati was&#xA;hurt by Indra&amp;rsquo;s discourtesy and, attributing&#xA;it to the arrogance of prosperity, silently&#xA;left the assembly.&#xA;Without the high priest of the gods, the&#xA;court lost in splendor and dignity and&#xA;became an unimpressive gathering.&#xA;Indra soon realized the foolishness of his&#xA;conduct and, sensing trouble for himself&#xA;from the acharya&amp;rsquo;s displeasure, he thought&#xA;to make up with him by falling at his feet&#xA;and asking for forgiveness.&#xA;But this he could not do, because&#xA;Brihaspati had, in his anger, made himself&#xA;invisible. This preyed on Indra&amp;rsquo;s mind.&#xA;With Brihaspati gone, Indra&amp;rsquo;s strength&#xA;began to decline, while that of the asuras&#xA;increased, which encouraged the latter to&#xA;attack the gods. Then Brahma, taking pity&#xA;on the beleaguered gods, advised them to&#xA;take unto themselves a new acharya.&#xA;Said he to them: &amp;ldquo;You have, through&#xA;Indra&amp;rsquo;s folly, lost Brihaspati. Go now to&#xA;Twashta&amp;rsquo;s son Visvarupa and request that&#xA;noble spirit to be your preceptor and all&#xA;will be well with you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Heartened by these words, the gods&#xA;sought the youthful anchorite Visvarupa&#xA;and made their request to him saying:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Though young in years, you are well&#xA;versed in the Vedas. Do us the honor of&#xA;being our teacher.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Visvarupa agreed, to the great advantage&#xA;of the gods for, as a result of his guidance&#xA;and teaching, they were saved from the&#xA;tormenting asuras.&#xA;Visvarupa&amp;rsquo;s, mother was of the asura clan&#xA;of daityas, which caused Indra to regard&#xA;Visvarupa with suspicion. He feared that&#xA;because of his birth, Visvarupa might not&#xA;be quite loyal and his suspicion gradually&#xA;deepened.&#xA;Apprehending danger to himself from this&#xA;descendent of the enemies of the gods,&#xA;Indra sought to entice him into error with&#xA;the temptresses of his court and so weaken&#xA;him spiritually. But Visvarupa did not&#xA;succumb.&#xA;The artful and seductive blandishments of&#xA;Indra&amp;rsquo;s glamour girls had no effect on the&#xA;young ascetic. He held fast to his vow of&#xA;celibacy. When Indra found that his plan&#xA;of seduction failed, he gave way to&#xA;murderous thoughts and one day killed&#xA;Visvarupa with the Vajrayudha.&#xA;The story goes that the world suffers&#xA;vicariously for this great sin of Indra.&#xA;And, as a result of it, parts of the earth&#xA;turned alkaline and became unsuitable for&#xA;cultivation and women came to be&#xA;afflicted with the physical troubles and&#xA;uncleanness peculiar to them. The&#xA;frothing of water is also attributed to this.&#xA;Twashta in his great rage and grief at&#xA;Indra&amp;rsquo;s cruel killing of his son and,&#xA;desirous of avenging his death, performed&#xA;a great sacrifice. And out of the sacrificial&#xA;flames sprang Indra&amp;rsquo;s mortal enemy&#xA;Vritra.&#xA;Twashta sent him against the chief of the&#xA;gods, saying: &amp;ldquo;Enemy of Indra, may you&#xA;be strong and may you kill Indra.&amp;rdquo; A great&#xA;battle raged between the two in which&#xA;Vritra was gaining the upper hand.&#xA;When the battle was going against Indra,&#xA;the rishis and the gods sought refuge in&#xA;great Vishnu who offered them protection&#xA;and said to them: &amp;ldquo;Be not afraid. I shallenter Indra&amp;rsquo;s Vajrayudha and he will win&#xA;the battle in the end.&amp;rdquo; And they returned in&#xA;good heart.&#xA;They went to Vritra and said to him:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Please make friends with Indra. You are&#xA;both equal in strength and valor.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vritra&#xA;respectfully&#xA;answered:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O&#xA;blameless ones, how can Indra, and I&#xA;become friends? Forgive me. There&#xA;cannot be friendship between rivals for&#xA;supremacy. Two great powers cannot&#xA;coexist as you know.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The rishis said in reply: &amp;ldquo;Do not entertain&#xA;such doubts. Two good souls can be&#xA;friends and their friendship is often after&#xA;hostility.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vritra yielded saying: &amp;ldquo;Well, then, I shall&#xA;cease fighting. But I have no faith in&#xA;Indra. He might take me unawares. So I&#xA;seek this boon of you, namely, that neither&#xA;by day nor by night, neither with dry&#xA;weapons nor with wet ones, neither with&#xA;stone nor with wood, nor with metals, nor&#xA;with arrows shall Indra be able to take my&#xA;life.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;So be it,&amp;rdquo; said the rishis and the gods.&#xA;Hostilities ceased. But soon Vritra&amp;rsquo;s fears&#xA;were confirmed. Indra only feigned&#xA;friendship for Vritra but was, all the time,&#xA;waiting for a suitable opportunity to slay&#xA;him.&#xA;One evening, he met Vritra on the beach&#xA;and began to attack him in the twilight.&#xA;The battle had raged for a long while&#xA;when Vritra praising the Lord Vishnu,&#xA;said to Indra: &amp;ldquo;Meanest of the mean, why&#xA;do you not use the unfailing Vajrayudha?&#xA;Hallowed by Hari, use it against me and I&#xA;shall attain blessedness through Hari.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Indra maimed Vritra by chopping off his&#xA;right arm but, undaunted, the latter hurled&#xA;with his left band, his iron mace at his&#xA;assailant who thereupon cut down his&#xA;other arm also. When Indra disappeared&#xA;into the mouth of Vritra, great was the&#xA;consternation of the gods.&#xA;But Indra was not dead. He ripped Vritra&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;belly open and issuing forth went to the&#xA;nearby&#xA;beach.&#xA;And&#xA;directing&#xA;his&#xA;thunderbolt at the water hurled it so that&#xA;the surf flew and hit Vritra. Vishnu having&#xA;entered the foam, it became a deadly&#xA;weapon and the mighty Vritra lay dead.&#xA;The long battle thus ended and the&#xA;afflicted world heaved a sigh of relief. But&#xA;to Indra himself, the end of the war&#xA;brought only ignominy because his&#xA;victory was secured through sin and deceit&#xA;and is went into hiding for sheer shame.&#xA;Indra&amp;rsquo;s disappearance caused the gods and&#xA;the rishis great distress. For a people&#xA;without a king or a council of state to&#xA;govern them cannot prosper. So they went&#xA;to the good and mighty king Nahusha and&#xA;offered him the crown.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Forgive me, I cannot be your king. Who&#xA;am I to aspire to the seat of Indra? How&#xA;can I protect you? It is impossible,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;humbly objected. But they insisted,&#xA;saying: &amp;ldquo;Do not hesitate. Be anointed our&#xA;king. All the merit and potency of our&#xA;penance will be yours and be an addition&#xA;to your strength. The power and the&#xA;energy of everyone you set your eyes on&#xA;shall be transferred to you and you will be&#xA;invincible.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus&#xA;over-powered,&#xA;he&#xA;agreed. Revolution is no new thing. This&#xA;story shows that, even in the world of the&#xA;gods, there was a revolution leading to&#xA;Indra&amp;rsquo;s dethronement and Nahusha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;installation as king in his stead. The story&#xA;of Nahusha&amp;rsquo;s fall is also instructive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE sin of the unrighteous slaughter of&#xA;Vritra pulled Indra down from his high&#xA;estate and made him a fugitive. Nahusha&#xA;became the king of the gods in his stead.&#xA;Nahusha started well, assisted by the merit&#xA;and the fame earned by him while he was&#xA;a king on earth. Thereafter, he fell on evil&#xA;days.The assumption of the kingship of the&#xA;gods filled him with arrogance, He lost his&#xA;humility and became filled with lawless&#xA;desires.&#xA;Nahusha indulged freely in the pleasures&#xA;of heaven and gave him up to untamed&#xA;and lecherous thoughts. One day, he saw&#xA;Indra&amp;rsquo;s wife and became enamored of her.&#xA;Possessed by evil thoughts, he spoke in&#xA;tones of command to the assembled gods:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why has not Sachidevi, the wife of the&#xA;king of the gods, come to me? Am I not&#xA;the king of the gods now? Send her to my&#xA;house soon.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When she learnt this, Indra&amp;rsquo;s wife was&#xA;indignant. In fear and distress, she went to&#xA;Brihaspati and cried out: &amp;ldquo;Preceptor, save&#xA;me from this wicked person.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Brihaspati offered her protection. &amp;ldquo;Fear&#xA;not &amp;quot; he said, &amp;ldquo;Indra will soon be back.&#xA;Stay here with me. You will regain your&#xA;husband.&amp;rdquo; When Nahusha learnt that&#xA;Sachidevi did not agree to fall in with his&#xA;wishes and that she sought and obtained&#xA;shelter under Brihaspati&amp;rsquo;s roof, he became&#xA;exceedingly angry.&#xA;The king&amp;rsquo;s displeasure frightened the&#xA;gods. They protested: &amp;ldquo;King of the gods,&#xA;be not angry. Your anger will make the&#xA;world sad. Sachidevi is another&amp;rsquo;s wife, do&#xA;not covet her. Do not swerve from the&#xA;path of righteousness.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But, the infatuated Nahusha would not&#xA;listen to them. Tauntingly, he said to&#xA;them: &amp;ldquo;When Indra lusted for Ahalya,&#xA;where&#xA;were&#xA;your&#xA;principles&#xA;of&#xA;righteousness and good conduct? Why did&#xA;you not prevent him then and why do you&#xA;stop me now? What did you do when he&#xA;so shamelessly murdered Visvarupa when&#xA;the latter was in penance and where was&#xA;your virtuous horror when he killed Vritra&#xA;through deceit? Sachidevi&amp;rsquo;s only course is&#xA;to come and live with me and it will be for&#xA;your good to get her reconciled to my&#xA;proposal and leave her in my charge. So,&#xA;now set about it,&amp;rdquo; ordered Nahusha.&#xA;The affrighted gods decided to talk the&#xA;matter over with Brihaspati and somehow&#xA;contrive to bring Sachidevi to Nahusha.&#xA;They all went to Brihaspati and related to&#xA;him what Nahusha had said and pleaded&#xA;that Sachidevi should submit to Nahusha’s&#xA;desires.&#xA;At which, the chaste Sachidevi shook with&#xA;shame and fear and cried out: &amp;ldquo;My God! I&#xA;cannot do it. I sought refuge in you. Oh&#xA;brahmana, do protect me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Brihaspati consoled her and said: &amp;ldquo;He,&#xA;who betrays one who has sought refuge,&#xA;will meet with destruction. The very earth&#xA;will not let the seed, that he sows, sprout.&#xA;I will not give you up. Nahusha&amp;rsquo;s end is&#xA;approaching. Be not afraid.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He indicated a way of escape from her&#xA;difficult situation by hinting that she&#xA;should pray for time, and the shrewd&#xA;Sachidevi took the hint and bravely went&#xA;to Nahusha&amp;rsquo;s palace.&#xA;As soon as Nahusha saw her, pride and&#xA;lust having deprived him of his senses, he&#xA;was beside himself with joy and said: &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;fair one, do not tremble. I am the lord of&#xA;the three regions. There can be no sin in&#xA;your becoming my wife.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing the wicked man&amp;rsquo;s words, the&#xA;virtuous Indrani, Indra&amp;rsquo;s wife, trembled for&#xA;a moment. Soon regaining composure she&#xA;replied: &amp;ldquo;King of the gods, before I&#xA;become yours, I have a request to make. Is&#xA;Indra alive or is he dead? If he is alive,&#xA;where is he? If, after making enquiries&#xA;and searching for him, I do not find him,&#xA;then no sin will attach to me and I could&#xA;become your wife with a clear&#xA;conscience.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Nahusha said: &amp;ldquo;What you say is right. Go&#xA;and search for him and be sure to return.&#xA;Remember the plighted word.&amp;rdquo; Saying&#xA;this, he sent her back to Brihaspati&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;house.The gods went to the great Vishnu and&#xA;complained to him of Nahusha. They said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lord, it was your might that killed Vritra&#xA;but Indra bears, the sin of it, and ashamed&#xA;and afraid to show himself in his unclean&#xA;state, he has hidden himself.&#xA;Pray indicate a way of deliverance for&#xA;him.&amp;rdquo; Narayana said in reply: &amp;ldquo;Let him&#xA;worship me. He will be cleansed of sin&#xA;and the evil-minded Nahusha will meet&#xA;with destruction.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sachidevi prayed to the goddess of&#xA;chastity, and, by her grace, reached where&#xA;Indra was in hiding. Indra had reduced&#xA;himself to the size of an atom and hid&#xA;himself in a fibre of the stem of a lotus&#xA;plant growing in Manasarovara. He was&#xA;doing penance in that state waiting for&#xA;better days. Sachidevi could not contain&#xA;herself for sorrow at her husband&amp;rsquo;s plight&#xA;and burst into tears. She acquainted him&#xA;with her troubles.&#xA;Indra spoke words of courage to her.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Nahusha&amp;rsquo;s end is drawing near,&amp;rdquo; he said.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Go to him by yourself and tell him that&#xA;you consent to his proposal. Ask him to&#xA;come to your residence in a palanquin&#xA;carried by ascetics. Then Nahusha will be&#xA;destroyed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sachidevi went and pretended to agree to&#xA;Nahusha&amp;rsquo;s proposal as Indra had asked her&#xA;to do. Overjoyed that she had returned to&#xA;him in this complaisant mood, the foolish&#xA;Nahusha burst out: &amp;ldquo;Blessed one, I am&#xA;your slave and ready to do you’re every&#xA;bidding. You have been true to your&#xA;word.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yes, I have come back. You will be my&#xA;husband. I want you to do something,&#xA;which I very much desire. Are you not the&#xA;lord of the world? It is my wish that you&#xA;should come majestically to my house in a&#xA;grander style than the great Vishnu or&#xA;Rudra or the asuras. Let the palanquin be&#xA;borne by the seven rishis. I shall then be&#xA;glad and receive you and bid you&#xA;welcome,&amp;rdquo; she said.&#xA;Nahusha fell into the trap. &amp;ldquo;What a grand&#xA;idea! Your imagination is wonderful. It&#xA;pleases me exceedingly. It is but proper&#xA;that the great rishis should carry me, who&#xA;am blessed with the powers of absorbing&#xA;the energy of those on whom my eyes fall.&#xA;I shall do exactly as you have&#xA;wished,&amp;ldquo;said he, and sent her back home.&#xA;The infatuated Nahusha called the rishis&#xA;and bade them carry him on their&#xA;shoulders.&#xA;At this sacrilege, the three worlds were&#xA;aghast and trembled. But worse was to&#xA;come as the palanquin was carried along.&#xA;Inflamed with thoughts of the beautiful&#xA;Sachidevi waiting for him, Nahusha was&#xA;impatient to reach her soon. So he began&#xA;goading the rishi-bearers of his palanquin&#xA;to go faster. And he went so far in his mad&#xA;wickedness as to kick Agastya, one of the&#xA;bearers, saying &amp;ldquo;sarpa, sarpa.&amp;rdquo; (Sarpa&#xA;means to move and also a serpent.) The&#xA;insanity of lust and arrogance had reached&#xA;its culmination. Nahusha&amp;rsquo;s cup of iniquity&#xA;was full.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Meanest of the mean, do thou fall from&#xA;heaven and become a sarpa on earth,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;cursed the rishi in his wrath. Immediately&#xA;Nahusha fell headlong, down from&#xA;heaven, and became a python in the jungle&#xA;and had to wait for several thousand years&#xA;for his deliverance. Indra was restored to&#xA;his state. He became the king of the gods&#xA;and Sachidevi&amp;rsquo;s grief ended.&#xA;Relating this story of the sufferings of&#xA;Indra and his wife to Yudhishthira and&#xA;Draupadi at Upaplavya, their uncle Salya&#xA;tried to comfort them.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Victory awaits the patient. Those, whom&#xA;prosperity makes arrogant, meet with&#xA;destruction. You, your brothers and&#xA;Draupadi have gone through untold&#xA;sufferings like Indra and his wife. Your&#xA;trials will soon be over and you willregain your kingdom. The evil-minded&#xA;Karna and Duryodhana will be destroyed&#xA;even as Nahusha was,&amp;rdquo; said Salya.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE Pandavas were camping at&#xA;Upaplavya in Virata&amp;rsquo;s territory. From&#xA;there, they sent emissaries to all friendly&#xA;rulers. Contingents arrived from all parts&#xA;of the country and soon, the Pandavas had&#xA;a mighty force of seven divisions. The&#xA;Kauravas did likewise and collected an&#xA;army of eleven divisions.&#xA;Then, as now, a division was made up of&#xA;all arms grouped together in accordance&#xA;with established military practice. In those&#xA;days, a division consisted of 21,870&#xA;chariots, an equal number of elephants,&#xA;thrice as many horses and five times as&#xA;many foot soldiers, and they were&#xA;provided with weapons of all kinds and&#xA;other war equipment.&#xA;Chariots were the &amp;ldquo;armored cars&amp;rdquo; of&#xA;ancient warfare and elephants, specially&#xA;trained for war, corresponded to the &amp;quot;&#xA;tanks&amp;quot; of modern times.&#xA;Drupada&amp;rsquo;s brahmana messenger reached&#xA;Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s court. After the usual&#xA;ceremonial introduction and enquiries&#xA;were over, the messenger addressed the&#xA;assembled gathering on behalf of the&#xA;Pandavas:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Law is eternal and of inherent validity.&#xA;You know this and I need not point it out&#xA;to you. Dhritarashtra and Pandu are both&#xA;Vichitravirya&amp;rsquo;s sons and are, according to&#xA;our usages, equally entitled to their&#xA;father&amp;rsquo;s property. In spite of this,&#xA;Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s sons have taken possession&#xA;of the whole kingdom, while Pandu&amp;rsquo;s sons&#xA;are without their share of the common&#xA;inheritance. There can be no justification&#xA;for this. Scions of the Kuru dynasty, the&#xA;Pandavas desire peace. They are prepared&#xA;to forget the sufferings they have&#xA;undergone and to let bygones be bygones.&#xA;They are unwilling to resort to war,&#xA;because they fully know that war never&#xA;brings any good but only destruction.&#xA;Render unto them, therefore, the things&#xA;that are due to them. This would be in&#xA;accordance both with justice and with the&#xA;agreement previously reached. Let there&#xA;be no delay.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After this appeal of the messenger, the&#xA;wise and brave Bhishma spoke. &amp;ldquo;By the&#xA;grace of God,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;the Pandavas are&#xA;safe and well. Although they have&#xA;obtained the support of many princes and&#xA;are strong enough for battle, they are not&#xA;bent on war. They still seek peace. To&#xA;restore to them their property is the only&#xA;right thing to do.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhishma had not finished when Karna&#xA;angrily broke in and, turning to the&#xA;messenger, exclaimed: &amp;ldquo;O brahmana, is&#xA;there anything new in what you have said?&#xA;What tortures it to tell the same old story?&#xA;How can Yudhishthira claim the property&#xA;that he lost at the game board? If, now,&#xA;Yudhishthira wants anything, he must beg&#xA;for it as a gift! He arrogantly prefers this&#xA;absurd claim in fond reliance on the&#xA;strength of his allies, particularly Matsya&#xA;and Panchala. Let me tell you clearly that&#xA;nothing can be got out of Duryodhana by&#xA;threats. As the plighted word, that the&#xA;Pandavas should live undiscovered during&#xA;the thirteenth year, has been broken, they&#xA;must once again go back to the forest for&#xA;another&#xA;twelve&#xA;years&#xA;and&#xA;return&#xA;thereafter.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhishma interposed: &amp;ldquo;Son of Radha, you&#xA;speak foolishly. If we do not do as this&#xA;messenger tells us, war will be upon us in&#xA;which we are certain to be defeated. And&#xA;Duryodhana and all of us are doomed to&#xA;destruction.&amp;rdquo; The disorder and excitement&#xA;in the assembly made Dhritarashtra&#xA;intervene.&#xA;He said to the messenger: &amp;ldquo;Having in&#xA;mind the good of the world and&#xA;considering the Pandava&amp;rsquo;s welfare, I havedecided to send Sanjaya to them. Please&#xA;return at once and tell Yudhishthira this.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Dhritarashtra called Sanjaya aside&#xA;and instructed him thus: &amp;ldquo;Sanjaya, go to&#xA;the sons of Pandu and convey to them my&#xA;affectionate regards and my kind inquiries&#xA;about Krishna, Satyaki and Virata. Give&#xA;all the princes assembled there my&#xA;regards. Go there on my behalf and speak&#xA;conciliatingly so as to secure the&#xA;avoidance of war.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sanjaya went to Yudhishthira on this&#xA;mission of peace. After the introductory&#xA;salutations,&#xA;Sanjaya&#xA;thus&#xA;addressed&#xA;Yudhishthira in the midst of his court:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dharmaputra, it is my good fortune to be&#xA;able to see you again with my eyes.&#xA;Surrounded by princes, you present the&#xA;picture of Indra himself. The sight&#xA;gladdens my heart. King Dhritarashtra&#xA;sends you his best wishes and desires to&#xA;know that you are well and happy. The&#xA;son of Ambika (Dhritarashtra) detests all&#xA;talk of war. He desires your friendship&#xA;and yearns for peace.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Dharmaputra heard Sanjaya say&#xA;this, he felt glad and answered: &amp;ldquo;If so,&#xA;Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s sons have been saved, nay,&#xA;we have all escaped a great tragedy. I, too,&#xA;desire only peace and hate war. If our&#xA;kingdom is returned to us, we will wipe&#xA;out all memories of the sufferings we have&#xA;undergone.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sanjaya spoke again: &amp;ldquo;Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s sons&#xA;are perverse. Disregarding their father&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;advice and their grandsire&amp;rsquo;s wise words,&#xA;they are still as wicked as ever. But you&#xA;should not lose patience. Yudhishthira,&#xA;you stand ever for right conduct. Let us&#xA;eschew the great evil of war. Can&#xA;happiness be gained with possessions&#xA;obtained through war? What good can we&#xA;reap from a kingdom won after killing our&#xA;own&#xA;relatives?&#xA;Do&#xA;not&#xA;therefore&#xA;commence hostilities. Even if one were to&#xA;gain the whole earth bounded by the&#xA;ocean, old age and death are inescapable.&#xA;Duryodhana and his brothers are fools.&#xA;But that is no reason why you should&#xA;swerve from rectitude or lose patience.&#xA;Even if they do not give back your&#xA;kingdom, you should not abandon the&#xA;supreme path of dharma.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira answered: &amp;ldquo;Sanjaya, what&#xA;you say is true. Rectitude is the best of&#xA;possessions, but are we committing&#xA;wrong? Krishna knows the intricacies of&#xA;rectitude and dharma. He wishes both&#xA;sides well. I shall do as Vasudeva orders.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Krishna said: &amp;ldquo;I desire the welfare of the&#xA;Pandavas. I desire also that Dhritarashtra&#xA;and his sons should be happy. This is a&#xA;difficult matter. I think I can settle this&#xA;issue by myself going to Hastinapura. If I&#xA;could obtain peace from the Kauravas on&#xA;terms that do not conflict with the welfare&#xA;of all, nothing would make me and the&#xA;Pandavas happier. If I succeed in doing&#xA;so, the Kauravas will have been rescued&#xA;from the jaws of death. I shall also have&#xA;achieved something good and worthwhile.&#xA;Even if, through a peaceful settlement, the&#xA;Pandavas get back what is due to them,&#xA;they will still serve Dhritarashtra loyally.&#xA;They desire nothing else. But they are also&#xA;prepared for war if need be. Of these two&#xA;alternatives, peace and war, Dhritarashtra&#xA;can choose what he pleases.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And Yudhishthira said to Sanjaya:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sanjaya, go back to the Kaurava, court&#xA;and tell the son of Ambika this from me:&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Was it not through your generosity that&#xA;we obtained a share of the kingdom when&#xA;we were young? You, who made me a&#xA;king once, should not deny us our share&#xA;now and drive us to make a beggar&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;living on the charity of others. Dear uncle,&#xA;there is enough room in the world for both&#xA;of us and the Kauravas. Let there be no&#xA;antagonism, therefore, between us.&amp;rsquo; Thus&#xA;should you request Dhritarashtra on my&#xA;behalf. Give the grandsire my love andregards and ask him to devise some way&#xA;of ensuring that his grandchildren live&#xA;happily in amity. Convey the same&#xA;message to Vidura also. Vidura is the&#xA;person who can best see what is good for&#xA;all of us and advise accordingly. Explain&#xA;matters to Duryodhana and tell him on my&#xA;behalf: &amp;lsquo;My dear brother, you made us,&#xA;who were princes of the realm, live in the&#xA;forest, clad in skins. You insulted and&#xA;harassed our weeping wife in the&#xA;assembly of princes. We bore all this&#xA;patiently. Give us back, at least now, what&#xA;is lawfully ours. Do not covet what&#xA;belongs to others. We are five. For the&#xA;five of us give at least five villages and&#xA;make peace with us. We shall be content.&#xA;Say thus to Duryodhana, Sanjaya. I am&#xA;prepared and ready for peace as well as&#xA;for war.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After Yudhishthira had said these words,&#xA;Sanjaya took leave of Kesava and the&#xA;Pandavas, and went back to Hastinapura.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AFTER he had despatched Sanjaya to the&#xA;Pandavas,&#xA;Dhritarashtra,&#xA;filled&#xA;with&#xA;anxiety, could not get a wink of sleep that&#xA;night. He sent for Vidura and spent the&#xA;whole night talking to him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;To give the Pandavas their share of the&#xA;kingdom is the safest plan,&amp;rdquo; said Vidura.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Only this can bring good to both sides.&#xA;Treat the Pandavas and your own sons&#xA;with equal affection. In this case, the right&#xA;course is also the wise one.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vidura counselled Dhritarashtra in this&#xA;manner at great length.&#xA;The next morning Sanjaya returned to&#xA;Hastinapura. And gave a full account of&#xA;what had taken place in Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;court.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Chiefly, Duryodhana should know what&#xA;Arjuna said: &amp;lsquo;Krishna and I are going to&#xA;destroy Duryodhana and his followers,&#xA;root and branch. Make no mistake about&#xA;it. The Gandiva bow is impatient for war.&#xA;My bowstring is throbbing even without&#xA;my stretching it and from my quiver,&#xA;arrows keep peeping out impatiently,&#xA;demanding when? When? Sanjaya, evil&#xA;stars make the foolish Duryodhana seek&#xA;war with Krishna and myself. Not even&#xA;Indra and the gods can defeat us.&amp;rsquo; Thus&#xA;spoke Dhananjaya,&amp;rdquo; said Sanjaya.&#xA;Bhishma counselled Dhritarashtra against&#xA;opposing the combined might of Arjuna&#xA;and Krishna. &amp;ldquo;Karna, who boasts&#xA;repeatedly that he will slay the Pandavas&amp;rdquo;,&#xA;said Bhishma, &amp;ldquo;is not equal to a sixteenth&#xA;part of the Pandavas. Your sons are&#xA;heading for destruction, listening to his&#xA;words. When Arjuna beat back your son&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;attack on Virata&amp;rsquo;s capital and humbled his&#xA;pride, what was Karna able to do? When&#xA;the Gandharvas took your son prisoner,&#xA;where did the invincible Karna bide&#xA;himself? Was it not Arjuna who drove&#xA;back the Gandharvas?&amp;rdquo; Thus did Bhisma&#xA;taunt Karna and warn the Kauravas.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What grandfather Bhisma says is the&#xA;only proper thing to do,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Dhritarashtra. &amp;ldquo;All wise men say, and I&#xA;know, that it is best to seek peace. But&#xA;what can I do? These fools would go their&#xA;own way, however loudly I protest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana, who had been listening to all&#xA;this, stood up. &amp;ldquo;Father, do not worry and&#xA;tremble about our safety. We know how&#xA;strong we are. That we shall win is&#xA;certain. Yudhishthira knows it too, for,&#xA;giving up all hope of kingdom, he only&#xA;begs now for five villages. Is it not clear&#xA;from this that he is already scared about&#xA;our eleven divisions? What can the&#xA;Pandavas oppose to our eleven divisions?&#xA;Why then do you doubt our victory?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana said to his father and tried to&#xA;cheer him up.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My son, let us not have war,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Dhritarashtra. &amp;ldquo;Be satisfied with half the&#xA;kingdom. It is enough if we govern thathalf well.&amp;rdquo; Duryodhana could stand it no&#xA;longer. &amp;ldquo;The Pandavas will not receive&#xA;even a needle-point of territory,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;exclaimed, and left the court. In the&#xA;excitement that prevailed, the court broke&#xA;up.&#xA;Let us now relate what the Pandavas were&#xA;saying among themselves. After Sanjaya&#xA;left&#xA;Upaplavya&#xA;for&#xA;Hastinapura,&#xA;Yudhishthira said to Krishna: &amp;ldquo;Vasudeva,&#xA;Sanjaya is Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s alter ego. From&#xA;his speech, I have divined what is in&#xA;Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s mind. Dhritarashtra is&#xA;trying to secure peace without giving us&#xA;any territory. In my simplicity, I was glad&#xA;at first when I heard Sanjaya speak. But it&#xA;soon became clear that my joy was&#xA;unfounded. He then struck a middle line&#xA;and spoke desiring peace. But the words&#xA;with which he ended his message seemed&#xA;to commend meekness to us, even if our&#xA;just rights were denied. Dhritarashtra has&#xA;not been playing fair with us. The crisis is&#xA;approaching. There are none but you to&#xA;protect us. I made my offer that we would&#xA;be content with only five villages. The&#xA;wicked Kauravas will refuse even this.&#xA;How can we tolerate this height of&#xA;intransigence? Only you can advise us in&#xA;this crisis. There is none but you who&#xA;knows what our duty is now and can&#xA;guide us in dharma as well as in&#xA;statesmanship.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Krishna said in reply: &amp;ldquo;For the good of&#xA;you both, I have decided to go to&#xA;Hastinapura. I shall go to Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;court and try to secure your rights without&#xA;war. If my mission succeeds, it will be for&#xA;the good of the world.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira said: &amp;ldquo;Krishna, pray do not&#xA;go. What is the good of your going to the&#xA;enemies&amp;rsquo; place now? The perverse&#xA;Duryodhana will stick to his folly. I do not&#xA;like your going among those unscrupulous&#xA;men. We cannot let you jeopardise your&#xA;safety, for the Kauravas will stop at&#xA;nothing.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Krishna answered: &amp;ldquo;Dharmaputra, I know&#xA;how wicked Duryodhana is. But still we&#xA;should make all attempts at a peaceful&#xA;solution so as to give the world no cause&#xA;to accuse us of not having done&#xA;everything possible to avert war. We must&#xA;omit nothing, no matter how slender our&#xA;hopes of success. Have no fears for my&#xA;safety, for, if the Kauravas offer me, a&#xA;messenger of peace, any threat of bodily&#xA;harm, I will reduce them to ashes.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Said Yudhishthira: &amp;ldquo;You are all-knowing.&#xA;You know our hearts as well as theirs. In&#xA;expounding matters and in the art of&#xA;persuasion, there is none better than you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Krishna said: &amp;ldquo;Yes, I know you both.&#xA;Your mind ever clings to righteousness&#xA;and theirs is always steeped in hatred,&#xA;jealousy and enmity. I will do all I can to&#xA;secure the result, which I know is dear to&#xA;you, a settlement reached without war&#xA;even though it may have, but little for&#xA;you. The signs are ominous and portend&#xA;war. Still duty demands that we should&#xA;make the attempt for peace.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus saying, Krishna took leave of the&#xA;Pandavas and set off in his chariot to&#xA;Hastinapura.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SATYAKI&#xA;accompanied&#xA;Govinda&#xA;(Krishna) to Hastinapura. Before setting&#xA;out on his journey, Krishna had a lone&#xA;discussion with the Pandavas. Even the&#xA;mighty&#xA;Bhima,&#xA;rather&#xA;surprisingly,&#xA;supported a peaceful settlement.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Let not the race be destroyed. Peace is&#xA;very much to be preferred,&amp;rdquo; said he. The&#xA;poet Vyasa makes Bhima speak thus in&#xA;order to show that truly great warriors&#xA;desire peace, and that to seek peace is not&#xA;a sign of fear.&#xA;But Draupadi could not forget her&#xA;humiliation. Holding her locks in her hand&#xA;she stood before Krishna, and in a voicequivering&#xA;with&#xA;grief,&#xA;she&#xA;said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Madhusudana, look at these tresses of&#xA;mine and do what honor requires to be&#xA;done. There can be no peace with honor.&#xA;Even if Arjuna and Bhima are against&#xA;war, my father, old though he is, will go&#xA;to battle, supported by my children. Even&#xA;if my father can keep out, my children,&#xA;with Subhadra&amp;rsquo;s son Abhimanyu, at their&#xA;head, will fight the Kauravas. I have, for&#xA;the sake of Dharmaputra, these thirteen&#xA;years, suppressed the burning flame of&#xA;anger within me. I can restrain myself no&#xA;longer.&amp;rdquo; And she sobbed, remembering&#xA;the great outrage.&#xA;Krishna was moved and said: &amp;ldquo;Weep not.&#xA;Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s sons will not listen to my&#xA;words of peace. They are going to fall and&#xA;their bodies will be food for wild dogs and&#xA;jackals. You will live to see us victorious&#xA;and the insult to you will be fully&#xA;avenged, and that too, soon.&amp;rdquo; Draupadi&#xA;was satisfied.&#xA;Madhava (Krishna) halted for the night&#xA;near the city of Kucasthala. When news of&#xA;Krishna&amp;rsquo;s forthcoming visit came, the city&#xA;was in great excitement.&#xA;Dhritarashtra issued orders for decorating&#xA;the city and arrangements for receiving&#xA;Janardana (Krishna) were in full swing.&#xA;Dhritarashtra issued instructions that&#xA;Duhsasana&amp;rsquo;s palace, being bigger and&#xA;more beautiful than Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s, should&#xA;be got ready and placed at the disposal of&#xA;Krishna and his entourage and large tents&#xA;were erected at several places outside the&#xA;city, along the route which Krishna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot was to take.&#xA;Dhritarashtra consulted Vidura. He said to&#xA;him: &amp;ldquo;Make arrangements for presenting&#xA;Govinda with chariots and elephants.&#xA;Presents of other kinds should also be got&#xA;ready.&amp;rdquo; But Vidura said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Govinda cannot be bought with presents.&#xA;Give him that for which he is coming to&#xA;the land of the Kurus. Does he not come&#xA;here seeking a peaceful settlement? Make&#xA;that possible. You cannot satisfy Madhava&#xA;with other gifts.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Govinda reached Hastinapura, the&#xA;citizens had thronged in such numbers in&#xA;the decorated streets that his chariot could&#xA;only progress very slowly. He went first&#xA;to Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s palace and then&#xA;proceeded to Vidura&amp;rsquo;s house. Kuntidevi&#xA;met him there.&#xA;Thinking of the sufferings of her sons and&#xA;overpowered by grief, she wept. Krishna&#xA;comforted her and, taking leave of her,&#xA;made for Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s palace.&#xA;Duryodhana gave Govinda welcome and&#xA;invited him to dinner, but Krishna said&#xA;with a smile: &amp;ldquo;Emissaries eat only after&#xA;their mission is fulfilled. You may give a&#xA;feast when my work here is completed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Declining Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s invitation, he&#xA;returned to Vidura&amp;rsquo;s house where he&#xA;rested.&#xA;Vidura and Krishna took counsel together.&#xA;Vidura told him that Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;arrogance was based on his confidence&#xA;that no one could defeat him as long as&#xA;Bhishma and Drona, who, he knew, were&#xA;under a moral obligation not to abandon&#xA;him, stood by him.&#xA;Vidura said that it would be a mistake for&#xA;Govinda even to enter the wicked man&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;court. All, who knew Duryodhana and his&#xA;brothers, apprehended that they would&#xA;plot, through fraud and deceit, against&#xA;Krishna&amp;rsquo;s life.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What you say about Duryodhana is true.&#xA;I have not come here with any hope that I&#xA;would be able to secure a peaceful&#xA;settlement, but only in order that the&#xA;world might not hold me to blame. Have&#xA;no fear for my life,&amp;rdquo; said Krishna.&#xA;The next morning, Duryodhana and&#xA;Sakuni came to Krishna and informed him&#xA;that Dhritarashtra was waiting for him.&#xA;Govinda went to the court along with&#xA;Vidura.As Vasudeva came into the court, that&#xA;great assemblage of kings stood up.&#xA;Saluting the elders with folded hands and&#xA;with a word or a smile for the others,&#xA;Krishna took his seat. The introductions&#xA;over, Govinda rose from his seat and,&#xA;turning to Dhritarashtra explained the&#xA;object of his visit. He made clear what the&#xA;Pandavas wanted.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dhritarashtra, do not bring ruin to your&#xA;people. You regard as bad what is good&#xA;for you and as good what is bad. It is your&#xA;duty to restrain your sons. The Pandavas&#xA;are prepared for war but they desire peace.&#xA;They wish to live in happiness under you.&#xA;Treat them also as your sons and devise&#xA;an honorable solution, and the world will&#xA;acclaim you,&amp;rdquo; said Krishna.&#xA;Dhritarashtra said: &amp;ldquo;My friends know that&#xA;I am not to blame. I desire precisely what&#xA;Madhava has stated but I am powerless.&#xA;My wicked sons do not listen to me.&#xA;Krishna, I entreat you to advise&#xA;Duryodhana.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Krishna turned to Duryodhana and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are the descendant of a noble i l ne.&#xA;Pursue the path of dharma. Your present&#xA;thoughts are unworthy and befit only men&#xA;of low birth. On account of you, this&#xA;famous line is in danger of being&#xA;destroyed. If you listen to reason and&#xA;justice, the Pandavas themselves will&#xA;install Dhritarashtra as king and you as the&#xA;heir apparent. Make peace with them by&#xA;giving them half the kingdom.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhishma and Drona also pressed&#xA;Duryodhana to listen to Govinda. But&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s heart could not be softened.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I pity Dhritarashtra and Gandhari whom&#xA;Duryodhana is dooming to bereavement&#xA;and desolation by his misdeeds,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Vidura.&#xA;Dhritarashtra once again said to his son:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If you do not listen to Govinda&amp;rsquo;s advice,&#xA;our race will perish.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Drona and Bhishma also tried repeatedly&#xA;to persuade Duryodhana and turn him&#xA;from error. Duryodhana was furious with&#xA;everyone for pressing him in this matter to&#xA;agree to a peaceful solution. He rose, and&#xA;said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Madhusudana, you wrong me out of love&#xA;for the Pandavas. The others here also&#xA;blame me, but I do not think I am one&#xA;whit to blame in this matter. The&#xA;Pandavas, of their own volition, staked&#xA;their kingdom at play and, being defeated,&#xA;justly forfeited it. How am I responsible&#xA;for it? Losing the game, they went to the&#xA;forests as in honor bound. For what fault&#xA;of mine do they now seek battle and wish&#xA;to slay us? I will not yield to threats.&#xA;When I was young, the elders did us&#xA;grievous wrong by giving the Pandavas, I&#xA;do not know why, a part of the kingdom&#xA;to which they had not a shadow of a right.&#xA;I acquiesced then but they lost it at play. I&#xA;refuse to return it to them. I am utterly&#xA;blameless. I will not give the Pandavas an&#xA;inch of land, not even a needle-point of&#xA;it!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Duryodhana said that he had not&#xA;committed wrong, Govinda laughed and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;The play was fraudulently arranged&#xA;by you in conspiracy with Sakuni and you&#xA;afterwards insulted Draupadi in an&#xA;assembly of princes. And yet, you have&#xA;the impudence to say that you have&#xA;committed no wrong,&amp;rdquo; and reminded him&#xA;of the other iniquities he had perpetrated&#xA;against the Pandavas.&#xA;Duhsasana seeing that Bhishma and others&#xA;were accepting Krishna&amp;rsquo;s indictment of&#xA;Duryodhana said: &amp;ldquo;Brother, it seems that&#xA;these people have a plot to bind you with&#xA;ropes and hand you over to the Pandavas.&#xA;Let us get away from here,&amp;rdquo; and&#xA;Duryodhana,&#xA;accompanied&#xA;by&#xA;his&#xA;brothers, walked out of the court.&#xA;Govinda addressed the court again and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Sires, the Yadavas and Vrishnis livehappily, now that Kamsa and Sisupala are&#xA;dead. In order to save a whole people, it is&#xA;some times necessary to sacrifice an&#xA;individual.&#xA;Does&#xA;it&#xA;not&#xA;happen&#xA;occasionally that a village is abandoned in&#xA;order that the country may be saved? I am&#xA;afraid you will have to sacrifice&#xA;Duryodhana if you want to save your race.&#xA;That is the only way.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhritarashtra said to Vidura: &amp;ldquo;Bring far-&#xA;sighted Gandhari here. It is possible that&#xA;Duryodhana might listen to her.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Gandhari was sent for and, when she&#xA;came to the court, Duryodhana was sent&#xA;for.&#xA;Duryodhana, his eyes red with anger,&#xA;returned and Gandhari tried by all the&#xA;means in her power to bring him round to&#xA;reason. Duryodhana said &amp;lsquo;No&amp;rsquo; and again&#xA;walked out of the hall.&#xA;He and his friends had plotted to seize&#xA;Krishna. News of this reached the court.&#xA;Govinda, who had anticipated all this,&#xA;laughed and disclosed his divinity.&#xA;The blind Dhritarashtra, by the grace of&#xA;Krishna, temporarily regained his sight&#xA;and was able to see Krishna in his&#xA;Visvarupa presence in every form.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Pundarikaksha,&#xA;(lotus-eyed&#xA;Krishna)&#xA;having seen your Visvarupa, I do not wish&#xA;to see anything else. I ask that I should be&#xA;blind again,&amp;rdquo; said Dhritarashtra, and he&#xA;became blind again. &amp;ldquo;All our efforts have&#xA;failed. Duryodhana is obstinate,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Dhritarashtra to Govinda.&#xA;And Krishna rose and, with Satyaki and&#xA;Vidura on either side of him, left the&#xA;court.&#xA;He went straight to Kunti. He told her&#xA;what had happened and she asked him to&#xA;convey her blessings to her sons.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The time has come,&amp;rdquo; said she, &amp;ldquo;for that&#xA;for which a kshatriya woman brings forth&#xA;sons. May you protect my sons!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;A kshatriya mother brings forth children&#xA;to be sacrificed in war. Purushottamat&#xA;(Krishna as Supreme Being) got into his&#xA;chariot and sped towards Upaplavya. War&#xA;became a certainty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ANY ray of hope there might have been&#xA;of a peaceful settlement when Krishna&#xA;went to Hastinapura was extinguished&#xA;when he returned and narrated what&#xA;happened. Kunti was overwhelmed with&#xA;grief when she learnt that it was to be war&#xA;to the death.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;How can I&amp;rdquo; reflected Kunti, &amp;ldquo;give my&#xA;thoughts tongue and say to my sons, &amp;lsquo;Bear&#xA;the insults. Let us not ask for any territory&#xA;and let us avoid war&amp;rsquo;? How can my sons&#xA;accept what is contrary to kshatriya&#xA;tradition?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;At the same time,&amp;rdquo; she thought, &amp;ldquo;what&#xA;can be gained by mutual killings in the&#xA;war and what happiness attained after the&#xA;destruction of the race? How shall I face&#xA;this dilemma?&amp;rdquo; Thus was she tormented&#xA;by the prospect of wholesale destruction&#xA;on the one hand and the claims of&#xA;kshatriya honor on the other.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;How can my sons defeat the mighty three&#xA;combined, Bhishma, Drona and Karna?&#xA;They are warriors who have never yet met&#xA;defeat. When I think of them, my mind&#xA;trembles. I do not worry about the others.&#xA;These three are the only people in the&#xA;Kaurava army capable of fighting the&#xA;Pandavas with any hope of slaying them.&#xA;Of these, Dronacharya might refrain from&#xA;killing my children from either love or&#xA;unwillingness to meet one&amp;rsquo;s own disciples&#xA;in battle. The grandsire will certainly not&#xA;want to kill them. But Karna is the&#xA;Pandavas&amp;rsquo; chief enemy. He is anxious to&#xA;please Duryodhana by killing my sons.&#xA;Karna is a great man-at-arms. As I think&#xA;of him engaged in battle against my other&#xA;sons, my heart is consumed with agony&#xA;like a faggot in the fire. Now is the time&#xA;for me, to seek Karna out and tell him the&#xA;truth about his birth, on knowing which,he is bound to abandon Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;cause.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Tormented by these anxious thoughts&#xA;about her children. Kunti went to the&#xA;banks of the Ganga where Karna usually&#xA;offered his daily prayers.&#xA;Karna was there at his devotions. Facing&#xA;east and with uplifted hands he was in&#xA;deep meditations. Kunti quietly stood&#xA;behind him and waited.&#xA;Karna was in meditation and was&#xA;unmindful of everything until he felt the&#xA;hot rays of the sun on his back.&#xA;His prayers over, Karna looked back to&#xA;find Kunti standing behind him and&#xA;holding the hem of his upper garment over&#xA;her head to shield it from the burning sun.&#xA;That Pandu&amp;rsquo;s queen and the mother of the&#xA;Pandava princes should be there, waiting&#xA;patiently for him to finish his prayers,&#xA;filled him with great confusion and&#xA;amazement.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The son of Radha and the chariot-driver&#xA;Adhiratha bows to you. I am at your&#xA;service. What can I do for you, O queen?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;asked Karna, according to the established&#xA;forms of respectful address.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Karna,&amp;rdquo; said Kuntidevi, &amp;ldquo;you are not&#xA;Radha&amp;rsquo;s son, nor is the charioteer your&#xA;father. Do not think that you are a man of&#xA;the chariot-driver&amp;rsquo;s caste. You are Surya&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;son born out of the womb of Pritha of&#xA;royal blood, otherwise known as Kunti.&#xA;May good fortune attend you&amp;rdquo;!&#xA;She then narrated the story of his birth.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You who were born with full armor and&#xA;golden earrings,&amp;rdquo; said Kunti, &amp;ldquo;not&#xA;knowing that the Pandavas are your&#xA;brothers, have joined Duryodhana and&#xA;have come to hate them. To live in&#xA;dependence on Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s sons, does&#xA;not befit you. Join Arjuna and be one of&#xA;the kings of the realm. May you and&#xA;Arjuna put down the wicked! The whole&#xA;world will be at your feet. Your fame will&#xA;reach far and wide, like that of the&#xA;brothers&#xA;Balarama&#xA;and&#xA;Krishna.&#xA;Surrounded by your five brothers, your&#xA;effulgence will be like that of Brahma&#xA;among the gods. In perplexing situations,&#xA;one must do what gives satisfaction to&#xA;loving parents. This is the highest dharma&#xA;according to our scriptures.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When his mother spoke thus to him at the&#xA;end of his devotions to the sun, Karna felt&#xA;a sign in his heart that the Sun god&#xA;endorsed Kunti&amp;rsquo;s request. But he checked&#xA;himself and took it to mean that the Sun&#xA;god was testing his loyalty and strength of&#xA;mind. He should not be found wanting.&#xA;With an effort of the will, he controlled&#xA;alike the temptations of self-interest and&#xA;the prompting of natural affection. He said&#xA;sadly but firmly: &amp;ldquo;What you have said,&#xA;dear mother, is contrary to dharma. If I&#xA;swerve from the path of duty, I shall have&#xA;done myself much more hurt than any that&#xA;an enemy might inflict on me in the&#xA;battlefield. You deprived me of all that&#xA;was my birthright as a kshatriya when you&#xA;threw me, a helpless babe, into the river.&#xA;And now, you talk to me of my duties as a&#xA;kshatriya. You denied me the motherly&#xA;love, which blesses all life. And now,&#xA;thinking of your other children&amp;rsquo;s good,&#xA;you tell me this story. If I now join the&#xA;Pandavas, will not the world proclaim that&#xA;I have done so out of fear? I have eaten&#xA;the salt of Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s sons, won their&#xA;confidence as their champion and enjoyed&#xA;all the consideration and kindness they&#xA;showed me. And now you want me, when&#xA;the battle is about to be joined, to be&#xA;untrue to my salt and go over to the&#xA;Pandavas. The sons of Dhritarashtra look&#xA;on me as the ark, which will enable them&#xA;to cross the deluge of war. I have myself&#xA;urged them into this war. How can I now&#xA;desert them? Could there be blacker&#xA;treachery and baser ingratitude? What in&#xA;life, or beyond it, would be worth a price&#xA;like that? Mother dear, I must dischargemy debt, aye, with life, if necessary;&#xA;otherwise, I shall be no better than a&#xA;common thief purloining my food all&#xA;these years. I shall surely use all my&#xA;followers against your sons in this coming&#xA;war. I cannot deceive you. Please forgive&#xA;me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;But yet,&amp;rdquo; continued he, &amp;ldquo;I cannot have&#xA;my mother plead completely in vain. Part&#xA;with Arjuna to me. Either he or myself&#xA;must die in this war. I will not kill your&#xA;other sons, whatever they may do unto&#xA;me. Mother of warrior sons, you will still&#xA;have five sons. Either I or Arjuna will&#xA;survive this war. And with the other four&#xA;sons, you will still have five&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;When Kunti heard her first-born speak&#xA;thus firmly, adhering to the kshatriya&#xA;code, her heart was full of tumultuous and&#xA;contrary feelings and, without trusting&#xA;herself to speak. She embraced him and&#xA;departed in silence.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Who can go against what has been&#xA;ordained?&amp;rdquo; she thought. &amp;ldquo;He has, at least,&#xA;offered not to harm four of my sons. That&#xA;is enough. May God bless him,&amp;rdquo; and she&#xA;returned home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GOVINDA reached Upaplavya and told&#xA;the Pandavas what had happened in&#xA;Hastinapura.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I spoke urging what was right and what&#xA;was also good for them. But, it was all in&#xA;vain. There is now no way out except the&#xA;fourth, that is, the last alternative of war.&#xA;The foolish Duryodhana would not listen&#xA;to the advice tendered to him by the elders&#xA;in the assembly. We must now prepare for&#xA;war without delay. Kurukshetra is waiting&#xA;for the holocaust.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;There is no longer any hope of peace,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Yudhishthira, addressing his brothers,&#xA;and issued orders for marshalling their&#xA;forces in, battle array.&#xA;They formed the army in seven divisions&#xA;and&#xA;appointed&#xA;Drupada,&#xA;Virata,&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna,&#xA;Sikhandin,&#xA;Satyaki,&#xA;Chekitana and Bhimasena at the head of&#xA;each division. They then considered who&#xA;should be appointed Generalissimo.&#xA;Addressing Sahadeva, Yudhishthira said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We should select one of these seven to be&#xA;Supreme Commander. He should be one&#xA;capable of successfully facing the great&#xA;Bhishma, who can burn enemies to ashes.&#xA;He should be one who knows how to&#xA;dispose his forces as circumstances&#xA;require from time to time. Who do you&#xA;think&#xA;is&#xA;most&#xA;fitted&#xA;for&#xA;this&#xA;responsibility?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In the olden days, it was the practice to&#xA;ascertain the views of younger people&#xA;first, before consulting elders. This&#xA;instilled enthusiasm and self-confidence&#xA;in the younger folk. If the elders were&#xA;consulted first, it would not be possible&#xA;for others to speak with freedom, and&#xA;even honest differences of opinion might&#xA;savor of disrespect.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Let us take as our Supreme Commander&#xA;the king of Virata who helped us when we&#xA;lived in disguise and with whose support&#xA;we now demand our share of the&#xA;kingdom,&amp;rdquo; replied Sahadeva.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;It seems to me best to make Drupada the&#xA;Generalissimo, for, in point of age,&#xA;wisdom, courage, birth and strength, he is&#xA;supreme,&amp;rdquo; said Nakula.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Drupada, the father of Draupadi, has&#xA;learnt archery from Bharadwaja, and has&#xA;for long been waiting for an encounter&#xA;with Drona. He is much respected by all&#xA;kings, and is supporting us, as if we were&#xA;his own sons. He should lead our army&#xA;against Drona and Bhishma.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dharmaputra then asked Dhananjaya for&#xA;his opinion. &amp;ldquo;I think, Dhrishtadyumna&#xA;should be our chief in the battlefield. The&#xA;hero who has his senses under control and&#xA;who has been born to bring about Drona&amp;rsquo;send. Dhrishtadyumna alone can withstand&#xA;the arrows of Bhishma whose skill in&#xA;archery made even the great Parasurama&#xA;hold back. He is the only man fitted to be&#xA;our commander. I can think of no one&#xA;else,&amp;rdquo; replied Arjuna.&#xA;Bhimasena said: &amp;ldquo;O king, what Arjuna&#xA;says is true, but the rishis and elders have&#xA;said that Sikhandin has come into the&#xA;world to kill Bhishma. My inclination&#xA;would be to give the command to&#xA;Sikhandin whose radiant face is like that&#xA;of Parasurama. I do not think any one else&#xA;can defeat Bhishma.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira finally asked Kesava for his&#xA;opinion. &amp;ldquo;The warriors mentioned are,&#xA;each one of them, worthy of selection,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Krishna. &amp;ldquo;Any one of them would fill&#xA;the Kauravas with fear. All things&#xA;considered, I would endorse Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;choice.&#xA;Anoint&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna,&#xA;therefore, as your Supreme Commander.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accordingly, Dhrishtadyumna, Drupada&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;illustrious son, who led Draupadi at the&#xA;swayamvara and gave her away to Arjuna,&#xA;who for thirteen long years was brooding&#xA;over the insult that his sister had to suffer&#xA;in Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s court, and who was&#xA;waiting for an opportunity to avenge the&#xA;wrong,&#xA;was&#xA;anointed&#xA;Supreme&#xA;Commander of the Pandava army.&#xA;The lion-roar of warriors, the blowing of&#xA;conchs and shells and the trumpeting of&#xA;elephants rent the air, With warlike cheers&#xA;which made the sky ring, the Pandava&#xA;army entered Kurukshetra in martial&#xA;array.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BALARAMA, the illustrious brother of&#xA;Krishna, visited the Pandavas, in their&#xA;encampment. As Halayudha (plough&#xA;bearer), clad in blue silk, entered&#xA;majestically like a lion. Yudhishthira,&#xA;Krishna and others gave the broad-&#xA;shouldered warrior a glad welcome.&#xA;Bowing to Drupada and Virata, the visitor&#xA;seated himself beside Dharmaputra.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have come to Kurukshetra,&amp;rdquo; said he,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;learning that the descendants of Bharata&#xA;have let themselves be overwhelmed by&#xA;greed, anger and hatred and that the peace&#xA;talks have broken down and that war has&#xA;been declared.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Overcome by emotion, he paused for a&#xA;while and then continued: &amp;ldquo;Dharmaputra,&#xA;dreadful destruction is ahead. The earth is&#xA;going to is a bloody morass strewn with&#xA;mangled bodies! It is an evil destiny that&#xA;has maddened the kshatriya world to&#xA;foregather here to meet its doom. Often&#xA;have I told Krishna, &amp;lsquo;Duryodhana is the&#xA;same to us as the Pandavas. We may not&#xA;take sides in their foolish quarrels.&amp;rsquo; He&#xA;would not listen to me. His great affection&#xA;for Dhananjaya has misled Krishna and he&#xA;is with you in this war which I see he has&#xA;approved. How can Krishna and I be in&#xA;opposite camps? For Bhima and&#xA;Duryodhana, both of them my pupils, I&#xA;have equal regard and love. How then can&#xA;I support one against the other? Nor can I&#xA;bear to see the Kauravas destroyed. I will&#xA;therefore have nothing to do with this war,&#xA;this conflagration that will consume&#xA;everything. This tragedy has made me&#xA;lose all interest in the world and so I shall&#xA;wander among holy places.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having thus spoken against the calamitous&#xA;war, Krishna&amp;rsquo;s brother left the place, his&#xA;heart laden with sorrow and his mind&#xA;seeking consolation in God.&#xA;This episode of Balarama’s, keeping out&#xA;of the Mahabharata war is illustrative of&#xA;the perplexing situations in which good&#xA;and honest men often find themselves.&#xA;Compelled to choose between two equally&#xA;justifiable, but contrary, courses of action,&#xA;the unhappy individual is caught on the&#xA;horns of a dilemma. It is only honest men&#xA;that find themselves in this predicament.&#xA;The dishonest ones of the earth have nosuch problems, guided as they are solely&#xA;by their own attachments and desires, that&#xA;is, by self-interest.&#xA;Not so the great men who have renounced&#xA;all desire. Witness the great trials to&#xA;which, in the Mahabharata, Bhishma,&#xA;Vidura, Yudhishthira and Karna were put.&#xA;We read in that epic how they solved their&#xA;several difficulties. Their solutions did not&#xA;conform to a single moral pattern but&#xA;reflected their several individualities. The&#xA;conduct of each was the reaction of his&#xA;personality and character to the impact of&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;Modern critics and expositors sometimes&#xA;forget this underlying basic factor and&#xA;seek to weigh all in the same scales,&#xA;which is quite wrong. We may profit by&#xA;the way in which, in the Ramayana,&#xA;Dasaratha,&#xA;Kumbhakarna,&#xA;Maricha,&#xA;Bharata and Lakshmana reacted to the&#xA;difficulties with which each of them was&#xA;faced.&#xA;Likewise, Balarama&amp;rsquo;s neutrality in the&#xA;Mahabharata war has a lesson. Only two&#xA;princes kept out of that war. One was&#xA;Balarama and the other was Rukma, the&#xA;ruler of Bhojakata. The story of Rukma,&#xA;whose younger sister Rukmini married&#xA;Krishna, is told in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BHISHMAKA, the king of Vidarbha, had&#xA;five sons and an only daughter, Rukmini,&#xA;a princess of matchless beauty, charm and&#xA;strength of character.&#xA;Having heard of Krishna and his renown,&#xA;she wished to be united to him in wedlock&#xA;and the desire daily grew in intensity. Her&#xA;relatives approved the idea, all except her&#xA;eldest brother Rukma, the heir apparent,&#xA;between whom and Krishna there was no&#xA;love lost.&#xA;Rukma pressed his father not to give&#xA;Rukmini in marriage to the ruler of&#xA;Dwaraka but to marry her instead to&#xA;Sisupala, the king of Chedi. The king&#xA;being old, Rukma&amp;rsquo;s became the dominant&#xA;voice and it looked as though Rukmini&#xA;would be compelled to marry Sisupala.&#xA;Rukmini, whose heart was wholly&#xA;Krishna&amp;rsquo;s because she was Lakshmi&#xA;incarnate, was disconsolate. She feared&#xA;that her father would be helpless against&#xA;her domineering brother and would not be&#xA;able to prevent the unhappy marriage.&#xA;Mustering all her strength of mind,&#xA;Rukmini resolved somehow to find a way&#xA;out of her predicament. She took counsel&#xA;with a brahmana whom, abandoning all&#xA;maidenly reserve, she sent as her emissary&#xA;to Krishna, charging him to explain&#xA;matters to her beloved and sue for help.&#xA;The&#xA;brahmana&#xA;accordingly&#xA;went&#xA;toDwaraka and conveyed to Krishna&#xA;Rukmini&amp;rsquo;s sad plight and her entreaty, and&#xA;handed to him the letter Rukmini had sent&#xA;through him. The letter ran as follows:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My heart has already accepted you as&#xA;lord and master. I charge you therefore to&#xA;come and succour me before Sisupala&#xA;carries me off by force. The matter cannot&#xA;brook any delay; so you must be here&#xA;tomorrow. Sisupala&amp;rsquo;s forces, as well as&#xA;Jarasandha&amp;rsquo;s, will oppose you and will&#xA;have to be overcome before you can have&#xA;me. May you be the triumphant hero and&#xA;capture me! My brother has decided to&#xA;marry me to Sisupala and, as part of the&#xA;wedding ceremonies, I am going to the&#xA;temple along with my retinue to offer&#xA;worship to Parvati. That would be the best&#xA;time for you to come and rescue me. If&#xA;you do not turn up, I will put an end to my&#xA;life so that I may at least join you in my&#xA;next birth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Krishna read this and immediately&#xA;mounted his chariot. At the king&amp;rsquo;s behest,&#xA;Kundinapura, the capital of Vidarbha, was&#xA;most&#xA;gorgeously&#xA;decorated&#xA;and&#xA;preparations for the wedding of the&#xA;princess with Sisupala were in full swing.The bridegroom elect and his associates,&#xA;all sworn enemies of Krishna, had already&#xA;assembled in the capital. Balarama came&#xA;to know of Krishna&amp;rsquo;s sudden and secret&#xA;departure, all by himself.&#xA;Guessing that it must be about the&#xA;daughter of the king of Vidarbha and&#xA;anxious lest Krishna should be hemmed in&#xA;alone by mortal enemies thirsting for his&#xA;blood, he hurriedly assembled a great&#xA;force and marched on to Kundinapura.&#xA;Leaving&#xA;her&#xA;apartments,&#xA;Rukmini,&#xA;accompanied by her retinue, went in&#xA;procession to the temple, where divine&#xA;service was held.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh Devi,&amp;rdquo; implored Rukmini, praying for&#xA;her intercession. &amp;ldquo;I prostrate myself before&#xA;thee who knowest my devotion. Grant that&#xA;Krishna may espouse me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Stepping out of the temple, Rukmini&#xA;sighted Krishna&amp;rsquo;s chariot and ran straight&#xA;as a needle to the attracting magnet. She&#xA;fled to him and got into his chariot. And&#xA;Krishna drove off with her, to the&#xA;bewilderment of all around.&#xA;The servants ran to Rukma, the heir&#xA;apparent, and related what had happened.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I will not return without killing&#xA;Janardana,&amp;rdquo; swore Rukma, and went in&#xA;pursuit of Krishna with a large force.&#xA;But, meanwhile, Balarama had arrived&#xA;with his army, and a great battle ensued&#xA;between the two opposing forces in which&#xA;the enemy was utterly routed. Balarama&#xA;and Krishna returned home in triumph,&#xA;where Rukmini&amp;rsquo;s wedding with Krishna&#xA;was celebrated with customary rites.&#xA;The defeated Rukma was ashamed to&#xA;return to Kundinapura and built at the&#xA;very site of the battle between Krishna&#xA;and himself a new city, Bhojakata, over&#xA;which he ruled.&#xA;Hearing of the Kurukshetra battle, Rukma&#xA;arrived there with a huge force. Thinking&#xA;that he could thereby win the friendship of&#xA;Vasudeva, he offered help to the&#xA;Pandavas.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh Pandavas,&amp;rdquo; said he addressing&#xA;Dhananjaya, &amp;ldquo;the enemy forces are very&#xA;large. I have come to help you. Give me&#xA;the word and I shall attack whichever&#xA;sector of the enemy formation you would&#xA;like me to. I have the strength to attack&#xA;Drona, Kripa or even Bhishma. I shall&#xA;bring you victory. Only let me know your&#xA;wish.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Turning&#xA;to&#xA;Vasudeva,&#xA;Dhananjaya&#xA;laughed.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh, ruler of Bhojakata,&amp;rdquo; said Arjuna, &amp;ldquo;we&#xA;are not afraid of the size of the enemy&#xA;forces. We have no need of your help and&#xA;do not particularly desire it. You may&#xA;either go away or stay on, just as you&#xA;like.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At this, Rukma was filled with anger and&#xA;shame and went to Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s camp&#xA;with his army. &amp;ldquo;The Pandavas have&#xA;refused my proffered assistance.&amp;rdquo; Said he&#xA;to Duryodhana. &amp;ldquo;My forces are at your&#xA;disposal.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Is it not after the Pandavas rejected your&#xA;assistance that you have come here?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;exclaimed Duryodhana, and added: &amp;ldquo;I am&#xA;not in such dire need yet as to welcome&#xA;their leavings.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rukma, thus put to disgrace by both sides,&#xA;returned to his kingdom without taking&#xA;part in battle. Neutrality in war may be of&#xA;several kinds.&#xA;It may arise from conscientious objection&#xA;to war or it may be due to mere conceit&#xA;and self-interest. Yet others may keep&#xA;aloof through cowardice or sheer inertia.&#xA;Balarama was neutral in the Mahabharata&#xA;war because of his love of peace. Rukma,&#xA;on the other hand, abstained as a result of&#xA;his conceit.&#xA;Instead of acting according to dharma, he&#xA;thought of personal glory, and neither side&#xA;would have him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IT was the day before the commencement&#xA;of the great battle. The grandsire, now the&#xA;Kaurava&#xA;Generalissimo,&#xA;was&#xA;with&#xA;Duryodhana seeking to inspire him with&#xA;his own heroic spirit and cheerfulness.&#xA;Bhishma spoke of the strength, skill and&#xA;prowess of the warriors ranged on the&#xA;Kauravas&amp;rsquo; side. Duryodhana was cheered&#xA;up. Presently, Karna became the subject&#xA;of their talk.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Karna has earned your affection,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Bhishma, &amp;ldquo;but I do not think much of him.&#xA;I do not like his great hatred of the&#xA;Pandavas, and he is too boastful. There is&#xA;no limit to his arrogance and he is much&#xA;given to disparaging others. I would not&#xA;place him in the highest rank among the&#xA;warriors of the land. Besides, he has given&#xA;away the divine armor with which he was&#xA;born. He is not therefore likely to be of&#xA;great help to me in this battle. The curse&#xA;of Parasurama is on him too. His&#xA;command of supernatural weapons will&#xA;fail him in his hour of need, for he will not&#xA;be able to remember the mantras. And the&#xA;battle that will ensue between him and&#xA;Arjuna will prove fatal for Karna.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus spoke Bhishma without mincing&#xA;matters, and this was exceedingly&#xA;unpalatable to Duryodhana and Karna. To&#xA;make matters worse, Drona agreed with&#xA;the grandsire and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Karna&#xA;is&#xA;full&#xA;of&#xA;pride&#xA;and&#xA;overconfidence, which will cause him to&#xA;be neglectful of the finer points of&#xA;strategy, and through carelessness, he will&#xA;suffer defeat.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Enraged by these harsh words, Karna&#xA;turned to the grandsire with flaming eyes.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You sir,&amp;rdquo; said he, &amp;ldquo;have always slighted&#xA;me through mere dislike and envy and&#xA;have never neglected an opportunity of&#xA;humiliating me, though I gave you no&#xA;reason. I bore all your taunts and thrusts&#xA;for the sake of Duryodhana. You have&#xA;said that I would not be of much help in&#xA;the impending war. Let me tell you my&#xA;settled conviction, it is you, not I, who&#xA;will fail the Kauravas. Why hide your real&#xA;feelings? The fact of the matter is that you&#xA;have&#xA;no&#xA;genuine&#xA;affection&#xA;for&#xA;Duryodhana, but he does not know it.&#xA;Hating me you seek to come between me&#xA;and Duryodhana and poison his mind&#xA;against me. And in furtherance of your&#xA;wicked design, you have been belittling&#xA;my strength and running me down. You&#xA;have stooped to behavior unworthy of a&#xA;kshatriya. Age alone does not confer a&#xA;title to honor and respect among warriors,&#xA;but prowess does. Desist from poisoning&#xA;our relations.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Turning then to Duryodhana, Karna said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Illustrious warrior, think well and look to&#xA;your own good. Do not place too great a&#xA;reliance on the grandsire. He is trying to&#xA;sow dissension in our ranks. His&#xA;appraisement of me will injure your cause.&#xA;By running me down, he seeks to dampen&#xA;my enthusiasm. He has become senile and&#xA;his time is up. His arrogance does not let&#xA;him have regard for anyone else. Age&#xA;must be respected and experience is useful&#xA;but, as the sastras warn us, there is a point&#xA;when age becomes senility and ripeness&#xA;falls into rottenness and decay. You have&#xA;made Bhishma your Generalissimo who&#xA;will, I have no doubt, earn some fame&#xA;from the heroic deeds of others. But I will&#xA;not bear arms while he is in command.&#xA;Only after he has fallen will I do so.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The arrogant man is never conscious of&#xA;his own arrogance. When accused of it, he&#xA;charges the accuser with that very fault.&#xA;His judgment is warped and he considers&#xA;it a crime on the part of anyone to point&#xA;out his defect. This is well illustrated in&#xA;this episode.&#xA;Controlling his anger, Bhishma replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Son of Surya, we are in a crisis and that&#xA;is why you have not ceased to live this&#xA;moment. You have been the evil genius ofthe Kauravas.&amp;rdquo; Duryodhana was in&#xA;distress.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Son of Ganga, I need the help of you&#xA;both,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;You will both do deeds of&#xA;great heroism, I have no doubt. At the&#xA;break of dawn, the battle joins. Let there&#xA;be no fighting among friends, with the foe&#xA;in full force before us!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Karna was adamant in that he would&#xA;not take up arms so long as Bhishma was&#xA;in&#xA;supreme&#xA;command.&#xA;Duryodhana&#xA;eventually yielded to Karna and suffered&#xA;him to carry out his threat.&#xA;Karna kept out during the first ten days of&#xA;the battle, though all his men participated&#xA;in it. At the end of the tenth day, when the&#xA;great Bhishma lay on the battlefield&#xA;covered all over with arrows, Karna went&#xA;to him and bowed reverently and asked&#xA;for forgiveness and blessings, which he&#xA;received.&#xA;Thereafter, Karna cooperated and himself&#xA;proposed Drona for the command of the&#xA;Kaurava forces in succession to Bhishma.&#xA;When Drona also fell, Karna took over the&#xA;command and led the Kaurava forces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ALL was ready for the battle. The&#xA;warriors on both sides gathered together&#xA;and solemnly bound themselves to honor&#xA;the traditional rules of war.&#xA;The code of conduct in war and methods&#xA;of warfare vary from time to time. It is&#xA;only if what was in vogue at the time of&#xA;the Mahabharata war is kept in mind that&#xA;we can understand the epic. Otherwise,&#xA;the story would be puzzling in places.&#xA;From what follows, the reader may have&#xA;some idea of the rules of warfare followed&#xA;in the Kurukshetra battle. Each day, the&#xA;battle was over at sunset, and the hostiles&#xA;mixed freely like friends.&#xA;Single combats might only be between&#xA;equals and one could not use methods not&#xA;in accordance with dharma. Thus those&#xA;who left the field or retired would not be&#xA;attacked. A horseman could attack only a&#xA;horseman, not one on foot.&#xA;Likewise, charioteers, elephant troops and&#xA;infantrymen could engage themselves in&#xA;battle only with their opposite numbers in&#xA;the enemy ranks.&#xA;Those who sought quarter or surrendered&#xA;were safe from slaughter. Nor might one,&#xA;for the moment disengaged, direct his&#xA;weapons against another who was&#xA;engaged in combat.&#xA;It was wrong to slay one who had been&#xA;disarmed or whose attention was directed&#xA;elsewhere or who was retreating or who&#xA;had lost his armor. And no shafts were to&#xA;be&#xA;directed&#xA;against&#xA;non-combatant&#xA;attendants or those engaged in blowing&#xA;conchs or beating drums.&#xA;These were the rules that the Kauravas&#xA;and the Pandavas solemnly declared they&#xA;would follow.&#xA;The passage of time has witnessed many&#xA;changes in men&amp;rsquo;s ideas of right and wrong.&#xA;Nothing is exempt from attack in modern&#xA;warfare.&#xA;Not only are munitions made the target of&#xA;attack, but dumb animals such as horses,&#xA;camels, mules and medical stores, nay,&#xA;non-combatants of all ages, are destroyed&#xA;without compunction.&#xA;Sometimes the established conventions&#xA;went overboard even in the Mahabharata&#xA;war.&#xA;We see clearly in the story that occasional&#xA;transgressions took place for one reason&#xA;or another. But, on the whole, the&#xA;accepted rules of honorable and humane&#xA;war were observed by both sides in the&#xA;Kurukshetra battle. And the occasional&#xA;violations were looked upon as wrong and&#xA;shameful.&#xA;Addressing the princes under his&#xA;command, Bhishma said: &amp;ldquo;Heroes, yours&#xA;is a glorious opportunity. Before you, are&#xA;the gates of heaven wide open. The joy of&#xA;living with Indra and Brahma awaits you.Pursue the path of your ancestors and&#xA;follow the kshatriya dharma. Fight with&#xA;joy and attain fame and greatness. A&#xA;kshatriya does not wish to die of disease&#xA;or old age in his bed but prefers to die on&#xA;the battlefield,&amp;rdquo; and the princes responded&#xA;by ordering their trumpets to be sounded&#xA;and shouted victory to the Kauravas.&#xA;On Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s flag shone brightly the&#xA;palm tree and five stars. On Aswatthama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;the lion tail fluttered in the air.&#xA;In Drona&amp;rsquo;s golden-hued standard, the&#xA;ascetic&amp;rsquo;s bowl and the bow glistened, and&#xA;the cobra of Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s famed banner&#xA;danced proudly with outspread hood.&#xA;On Kripa&amp;rsquo;s flag was depicted a bull, while&#xA;Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s carried a wild boar. Likewise&#xA;others and the battlefield thus presented a&#xA;pageant of flags.&#xA;Seeing the Kaurava forces ranged in battle&#xA;array, Yudhishthira gave orders to Arjuna:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The enemy force is very large. Our army&#xA;being smaller, our tactics should be&#xA;concentration rather than deployment that&#xA;will only weaken us. Array our forces,&#xA;therefore, in needle formation.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Now, when Arjuna saw men arrayed on&#xA;both sides for mutual slaughter, he was&#xA;deeply agitated and Krishna spoke to him&#xA;in order to quell his agitation and remove&#xA;his doubts.&#xA;Krishna&amp;rsquo;s exhortation to Arjuna at this&#xA;juncture is the Bhagavad Gita, which is&#xA;enshrined in millions of hearts as the&#xA;Word of God. The Bhagavad Gita is&#xA;acknowledged by all as one of the&#xA;supreme treasures of human literature.&#xA;Its gospel of devotion to duty, without&#xA;attachment or desire of reward, has shown&#xA;the way of life for all men, rich or poor,&#xA;learned or ignorant, who have sought for&#xA;light in the dark problems of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EVERYTHING was ready for the battle&#xA;to begin. At this tense moment, both&#xA;armies saw with amazement Yudhishthira,&#xA;the steadfast and brave son of Pandu,&#xA;suddenly doff his armor and put away his&#xA;weapons. Descending from his chariot, he&#xA;proceeded on foot towards the commander&#xA;of the Kaurava forces.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What is this that Yudhishthira is doing?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;asked everyone and was puzzled by this&#xA;sudden and silent proceeding on the part&#xA;of the Pandava.&#xA;Dhananjaya too was perplexed and he&#xA;jumped down from his chariot and ran to&#xA;Yudhishthira. The other brothers and&#xA;Krishna also joined.&#xA;They feared that perhaps Yudhishthira,&#xA;surrendering to his natural inclination, had&#xA;suddenly decided to seek peace on any&#xA;terms and was going forward to announce&#xA;this.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;King, why are you proceeding to the&#xA;enemy&amp;rsquo;s lines in this strange manner? You&#xA;have told us nothing. The enemy is ready&#xA;for battle, their soldiers sheathed in armor&#xA;and with uplifted weapons. But you have&#xA;doffed your armor and thrown aside your&#xA;weapons and are proceeding forward,&#xA;unattended and on foot. Tell us what you&#xA;are about.&amp;rdquo; Thus said Arjuna to&#xA;Dharmaputra. But Yudhishthira was&#xA;immersed in deep thought and proceeded&#xA;forward silently.&#xA;Then Vasudeva, who knew the hearts of&#xA;men, smiled and said: &amp;ldquo;He is going to the&#xA;elders to ask for their benediction before&#xA;commencing this terrible fight. He feels it&#xA;is not right to start such a grave&#xA;proceeding without formally taking such&#xA;benediction and permission. He goes to&#xA;the grandsire to take his blessing and that&#xA;of Dronacharya. So he goes unarmed. It is&#xA;right that he does this. He knows&#xA;proprieties. It is only thus that we might&#xA;fare well in this battle.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The men in Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s army, when&#xA;they saw Yudhishthira advancing with&#xA;hands clasped in humble attitude, thought:&amp;ldquo;Here is the Pandava coming to sue for&#xA;peace, frightened at our strength. Truly&#xA;this man brings disgrace to the race of&#xA;kshatriyas. Why was this coward born&#xA;among us?&amp;rdquo; Thus did they talk among&#xA;themselves reviling Dharmaputra though&#xA;delighted at the prospect of securing&#xA;victory without a blow.&#xA;Yudhishthira went through the lines of&#xA;soldiers armed from head to foot and&#xA;proceeded straight to where Bhishma was&#xA;and, bending low and touching his feet in&#xA;salutation, said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Grandsire, permit us to begin the battle.&#xA;We have dared to give battle to you, our&#xA;unconquerable&#xA;and&#xA;incomparable&#xA;grandsire. We seek benediction before&#xA;beginning the fight.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Child,&amp;rdquo; replied the grandsire, &amp;ldquo;born in the&#xA;race of Bharatas, you have acted worthily&#xA;and according to our code of conduct. It&#xA;gives me joy to see this. Fight and you&#xA;will have victory. I am not a free agent. I&#xA;am bound by my obligation to the king&#xA;and must fight on the side of the&#xA;Kauravas. But you will not be defeated.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After thus obtaining the permission and&#xA;the&#xA;blessings&#xA;of&#xA;the&#xA;grandsire,&#xA;Yudhishthira went to Drona and&#xA;circumambulated and bowed, according to&#xA;form, to the acharya, who also gave his&#xA;blessings, saying:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I am under inescapable obligations to the&#xA;Kauravas, O son of Dharma. Our vested&#xA;interests enslave us and become our&#xA;masters. Thus have I become bound to the&#xA;Kauravas. I shall fight on their side. But&#xA;yours will be the victory.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira similarly approached and&#xA;obtained the blessings of Kripacharya and&#xA;uncle Salya and returned to the Pandava&#xA;lines.&#xA;The battle began, commencing with single&#xA;combats between the leading chiefs armed&#xA;with equal weapons. Bhishma and Partha,&#xA;Satyaki and Kritavarma, Abhimanyu and&#xA;Brihatbala, Duryodhana and Bhima,&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;and&#xA;Salya,&#xA;and&#xA;Dbrishtadyumna and Drona were thus&#xA;engaged in great battles.&#xA;Similarly, thousands of other warriors&#xA;fought severally according to the rules of&#xA;war of those days.&#xA;Besides these numerous single combats&#xA;between renowned warriors, there was&#xA;also&#xA;indiscriminate&#xA;fighting&#xA;among&#xA;common soldiers. The name of &amp;ldquo;sankula&#xA;yuddha&amp;rdquo; was given to such free fighting&#xA;and&#xA;promiscuous&#xA;carnage.&#xA;The&#xA;Kurukshetra battle witnessed many such&#xA;&amp;ldquo;sankula&amp;rdquo; fights wherein countless men&#xA;fought and died in the mad lust of battle.&#xA;On the field lay piles of slaughtered&#xA;soldiers, charioteers, elephants and horses.&#xA;The ground became a bloody mire in&#xA;which it was difficult for the chariots to&#xA;move about. In modern battles there is no&#xA;such thing as single combats. It is all&#xA;&amp;ldquo;sankula.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Kauravas fought under Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;command for ten days. After him, Drona&#xA;took the command. When Drona died,&#xA;Karna succeeded to the command. Karna&#xA;fell towards the close of the seventeenth&#xA;day&amp;rsquo;s battle. And Salya led the Kaurava&#xA;army on the eighteenth and last day.&#xA;Towards the latter part of the battle, many&#xA;savage and unchivalrous deeds were done.&#xA;Chivalry and rules of war die hard, for&#xA;there is an innate nobility in human&#xA;nature. But difficult situations and&#xA;temptations arise which men are too weak&#xA;to resist, especially when they are&#xA;exhausted with fighting and warped with&#xA;hatred and bloodshed.&#xA;Even great men commit wrong and their&#xA;lapses thereafter furnish bad examples to&#xA;others, and dharma comes to be&#xA;disregarded more and more easily and&#xA;frequently. Thus does violence beget and&#xA;nourish adharma and plunge the world in&#xA;wickedness.64. THE FIRST DAY&amp;rsquo;S BATTLE&#xA;DUHSASANA was leading the Kaurava&#xA;forces and Bhimasena did the same on the&#xA;Pandava side. The noise of battle rolled&#xA;and rent the air. The kettledrums,&#xA;trumpets, horns and conchs made the sky&#xA;ring with their clamor.&#xA;Horses&#xA;neighed,&#xA;charging&#xA;elephants&#xA;trumpeted and the warriors uttered their&#xA;lion-roars. Arrows flew in the air like&#xA;burning meteors. Fathers and sons, uncles&#xA;and nephews slew one another forgetful of&#xA;old affection and ties of blood. It was a&#xA;mad and terrible carnage. In the forenoon&#xA;of the first day&amp;rsquo;s battle the Pandava army&#xA;was badly shaken. Wherever Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot went, it was like the dance of the&#xA;destroyer. Abhimanyu could not bear this&#xA;and he attacked the grandsire. When the&#xA;oldest and the youngest warriors thus met&#xA;in battle, the gods came to watch the&#xA;combat. Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s flag, displaying the&#xA;golden karnikara tree brightly waved on&#xA;his chariot.&#xA;Kritavarma was hit by one of his arrows&#xA;and Salya was hit five times. Bhishma&#xA;himself&#xA;was&#xA;hit&#xA;nine&#xA;times&#xA;by&#xA;Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;shafts.&#xA;Durmukha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;charioteer was struck by one of&#xA;Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s sword-edge arrow and his&#xA;severed head rolled on the ground.&#xA;Another broke Kripa&amp;rsquo;s bow. Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;feats brought down showers of flowers&#xA;from the gods who looked on. Bhishma&#xA;and the warrior supporting him exclaimed:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Indeed, a worthy son to Dhananjaya!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then the Kaurava warriors made a&#xA;combined attack on the valiant youth. But&#xA;he stood against them all. He parried with&#xA;his own all the shafts discharged by&#xA;Bhishma.&#xA;One of his well-aimed arrows brought the&#xA;grandsire&amp;rsquo;s palm tree flag down. Seeing&#xA;this, Bhimasena was overjoyed and made&#xA;a great lion-roar that further inspired the&#xA;valiant nephew. Great was the grandsire&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;joy, seeing the valor of the young hero.&#xA;Unwillingly, he had to use his full&#xA;strength against the boy. Virata, his son&#xA;Uttara, Dhrishtadyumna, the son of&#xA;Drupada and Bhima came to relieve the&#xA;young hero and attacked the grandsire&#xA;who then turned his attentions on them.&#xA;Uttara, the son of Virata, rode an elephant&#xA;and led a fierce charge on Salya. Salya&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot horses were trampled to death and&#xA;thereupon he hurled a javelin at Uttara. It&#xA;went with unerring aim and pierced him in&#xA;the chest.&#xA;The goad he had in his hand dropped and&#xA;he rolled down dead. But the elephant did&#xA;not withdraw. It continued charging until&#xA;Salya cut off its trunk and hit it in many&#xA;places with his arrows. And then it uttered&#xA;a loud cry and fell dead. Salya got into&#xA;Kritavarma&amp;rsquo;s car.&#xA;Virata&amp;rsquo;s son Sveta saw Salya slay his&#xA;younger brother. His anger rose, like fire&#xA;fed by libations of butter. And he drove&#xA;his chariot towards Salya. Seven chariot&#xA;warriors at once came up in support of&#xA;Salya and protected him from all sides.&#xA;Arrows were showered on Sveta and the&#xA;missiles sped across like lightning in&#xA;clouds.&#xA;Sveta&#xA;defended&#xA;himself&#xA;marvelously. He parried their shafts with&#xA;his own and cut their javelins down as&#xA;they sped towards him. The warriors in&#xA;both armies were amazed at the skill&#xA;displayed by Sveta. Duryodhana lost no&#xA;time now and sent forces to relieve Salya.&#xA;Whereupon there was a great battle.&#xA;Thousands of soldiers perished, and&#xA;numerous were the chariots broken and&#xA;the horses and elephants killed. Sveta&#xA;succeeded in putting Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s men to&#xA;flight and he pushed forward and attacked&#xA;Bhishma.&#xA;Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s flag was brought down by&#xA;Sveta. Bhishma, in his turn, killed Sveta&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;horses and charioteer. There upon, theyhurled javelins at one another and fought&#xA;on.&#xA;Sveta took a mace, and swinging it, sent it&#xA;at Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s car which was smashed to&#xA;pieces. But the grandsire, even before the&#xA;mace dashed against the chariot, had&#xA;anticipated it and jumped down. From the&#xA;ground he pulled the string of his bow to&#xA;his ear and sent a fatal arrow at Sveta.&#xA;Sveta was struck and fell dead. Duhsasana&#xA;blew his horn and danced in joy. This was&#xA;followed by a great attack on the Pandava&#xA;army by Bhishma.&#xA;The Pandava forces suffered greatly on&#xA;the first day of the battle. Dharmaputra&#xA;was seized with apprehension, and&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s joy was unbounded. The&#xA;brothers came to Krishna and were&#xA;engaged in anxious consultations.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Chief among Bharatas,&amp;rdquo; said Krishna to&#xA;Yudhishthira, &amp;ldquo;do not fear. God has&#xA;blessed you with valiant brothers. Why&#xA;should you entertain any doubts? There is&#xA;Satyaki and there are Virata, Drupada and&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna, besides myself. What&#xA;reason is there for you to be dejected? Do&#xA;you forget that Sikhandin is awaiting for&#xA;his predestined victim Bhishma?&amp;rdquo; Thus&#xA;did Krishna comfort Yudhishthira.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE Pandava army, having fared badly&#xA;on the first day of the battle,&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna,&#xA;the&#xA;Generalissimo,&#xA;devised measures to avoid a repetition of&#xA;it. On the second day, the army was most&#xA;carefully arrayed and everything was done&#xA;to instil confidence.&#xA;Duryodhana, filled with conceit on&#xA;account of the success on the first day,&#xA;stood in the center of his army and&#xA;addressed his warriors.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Heroes in armor&amp;rdquo;, he said in a loud voice,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;our victory is assured. Fight and care not&#xA;for life.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Kaurava army, led by Bhishma, again&#xA;made strong attack on the Pandava forces&#xA;and broke their formation, killing large&#xA;numbers.&#xA;Arjuna, turning to Krishna, his charioteer,&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;If we continue in this way, our army&#xA;will soon be totally destroyed by the&#xA;grandsire. Unless we slay Bhishma, I am&#xA;afraid we can not save our army.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dhananjaya, then get ready. There is the&#xA;grandsire&amp;rsquo;s chariot,&amp;rdquo; replied Krishna, and&#xA;drove straight towards him.&#xA;The chariot sped forward at a great pace.&#xA;The grandsire sent his shafts welcoming&#xA;the challenge. Duryodhana had ordered&#xA;his men to protect the grandsire most&#xA;vigilantly and never to let him expose&#xA;himself to danger.&#xA;Accordingly, all the warriors, supporting&#xA;the grandsire, at once intervened and&#xA;attacked Arjuna who, however, fought on&#xA;unconcerned.&#xA;It was well known that there were but&#xA;three on the Kaurava side who could stand&#xA;against Arjuna with any chance of success&#xA;the grandsire Bhishma, Drona and Karna.&#xA;Arjuna made short work of the warriors,&#xA;who intervened in support of Bhishma.&#xA;The way in which he wielded his great&#xA;bow on this occasion, extorted the&#xA;admiration of all the great generals in the&#xA;army. His chariot flashed hither and&#xA;thither sundering hostile ranks like forked&#xA;lightning, so rapidly that the eye ached to&#xA;follow its career.&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s heart beat fast as he&#xA;watched this combat. His confidence in&#xA;the great Bhishma began to be shaken.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Son of Ganga,&amp;rdquo; Duryodhana said, &amp;ldquo;it&#xA;seems as if even while you and Drona are&#xA;alive&#xA;and fighting, this irresistible&#xA;combination of Arjuna and Krishna will&#xA;destroy our entire army. Karna whose&#xA;devotion and loyalty to me are most&#xA;genuine stands aside and does not fight for&#xA;me only because of you. I fear I shall be&#xA;deceived and you will not take steps&#xA;quickly to destroy Phalguna (Arjuna).&amp;ldquo;The gods came down to watch the combat&#xA;between Bhishma and Arjuna. These were&#xA;two of the greatest warriors on earth. Both&#xA;chariots were drawn by white steeds.&#xA;From either side flew arrows in countless&#xA;number. Shaft met shaft in the air and&#xA;sometimes the grandsire&amp;rsquo;s missile hit&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s breast and that of Madhava&#xA;(Krishna). And the blood flowing made&#xA;Madhava more beautiful than ever as he&#xA;stood like a green palasa tree in full bloom&#xA;with crimson flowers.&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s wrath rose when he saw his dear&#xA;charioteer hit and he pulled his bow and&#xA;sent well-aimed arrows at the grandsire.&#xA;The combatants were equal and the battle&#xA;raged for a long while.&#xA;In the movements the chariots made they&#xA;were so close to one another and moved&#xA;about so fast that it was not possible to say&#xA;where Arjuna was and where Bhishma.&#xA;Only the flag could be distinguished.&#xA;As this great and wonderful scene was&#xA;enacted in one part of the field, at another&#xA;place a fierce battle was being fought&#xA;between Drona and his born enemy&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna, the son of the king of&#xA;the Panchalas and brother of Draupadi.&#xA;Drona&amp;rsquo;s attack was powerful and&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna was wounded badly. But&#xA;the latter retaliated with equal vigor and&#xA;with a grin of hatred he shot arrows and&#xA;sped other missiles at Drona.&#xA;Drona defended himself with great skill.&#xA;He parried the sharp missiles and the&#xA;heavy maces hurled at him with his&#xA;arrows and broke them to pieces even as&#xA;they sped in the air.&#xA;Many times did Dhrishtadyumna&amp;rsquo;s bow&#xA;break, hit by Drona&amp;rsquo;s arrows. One of&#xA;Drona&amp;rsquo;s arrows killed the Panchala&#xA;prince&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;charioteer.&#xA;Thereupon&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna took up a mace and,&#xA;jumping down from the chariot, went&#xA;forward on foot.&#xA;Drona sent an arrow that brought the mace&#xA;down. Dhrishtadyumna then drew his&#xA;sword and rushed forward like a lion&#xA;springing on its elephant prey. But Drona&#xA;again disabled him and prevented his&#xA;advance.&#xA;Just then Bhima, who saw the Panchala&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;predicament, sent a shower of arrows on&#xA;Drona and carried Dhrishtadyumna to&#xA;safety in his chariot.&#xA;Duryodhana who saw this sent the&#xA;Kalinga forces against Bhimasena. Bhima&#xA;killed the Kalinga warriors in great&#xA;number. Like Death itself he moved about&#xA;among his enemies and felled them to the&#xA;ground. So fierce was the destruction that&#xA;the entire army trembled in fear.&#xA;When Bhishma saw this, he came to&#xA;relieve the Kalingas. Satyaki, Abhimanyu&#xA;and other warriors came up in support of&#xA;Bhima. One of Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s shafts brought&#xA;Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s charioteer down and the horses&#xA;of Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s chariot, left uncontrolled,&#xA;bolted carrying Bhishma away from the&#xA;field.&#xA;The Pandava army was wild with&#xA;enthusiasm when Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s chariot sped&#xA;thus out of the field. They took advantage&#xA;of the situation and made a fierce attack&#xA;on the Kaurava army.&#xA;Great was the loss the Kaurava army&#xA;suffered in that day&amp;rsquo;s battle as a result of&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s deeds of valor. The generals of&#xA;the Kaurava army were greatly perturbed&#xA;and their previous day&amp;rsquo;s enthusiasm had&#xA;all disappeared.&#xA;They eagerly looked forward to sunset&#xA;when there would be an end to the day&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;battle. As the sun sank in the west,&#xA;Bhishma said to Drona: &amp;ldquo;It is well we stop&#xA;the fighting now. Our army is&#xA;disheartened and weary.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;On the side of the Pandavas, Dhananjaya&#xA;and others returned in great cheer to their&#xA;camp, with bands playing. At the end of&#xA;the second day&amp;rsquo;s battle, the Kauravas werein the mood that the Pandavas were in the&#xA;previous evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ON the morning of the third day Bhishma&#xA;arrayed his army in eagle formation and&#xA;himself led it while Duryodhana and his&#xA;forces protected the rear. So great was the&#xA;care taken over every detail that the&#xA;Kauravas were certain that there could be&#xA;no mishap for them that day.&#xA;The Pandavas too arrayed their forces&#xA;with&#xA;skill.&#xA;Dhananjaya&#xA;and&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna decided in favor of a&#xA;crescent formation of their army so as&#xA;more effectually to cope with the eagle&#xA;formation of the enemy&amp;rsquo;s forces.&#xA;On the right horn of the crescent stood&#xA;Bhima and on the left Arjuna, leading the&#xA;respective divisions. The battle began. All&#xA;arms were at once engaged and blood&#xA;flowed in torrents and the dust that was&#xA;raised by chariots, horses and elephants&#xA;rose to hide the sun.&#xA;Dhananjaya&amp;rsquo;s attack was powerful but the&#xA;enemy stood firm. A counter-attack was&#xA;made by the Kauravas concentrating on&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s position. Javelins and spears and&#xA;other missiles flew in the air shining like&#xA;forked lightning in a thunderstorm.&#xA;Like a great cloud of locusts the shafts&#xA;covered Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s chariot. But with&#xA;amazing skill he raised a moving&#xA;fortification around his chariot with&#xA;arrows discharged in an unending stream&#xA;from his famous bow.&#xA;At another point Sakuni led a large force&#xA;against Satyaki and Abhimanyu. Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot was broken to pieces and he had to&#xA;scramble up Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s chariot and&#xA;thereafter both fought from the same&#xA;chariot.&#xA;They were able to destroy Sakuni&amp;rsquo;s forces.&#xA;Drona and Bhishma jointly attacked&#xA;Dharmaputra&amp;rsquo;s division and Nakula and&#xA;Sahadeva joined their brother in opposing&#xA;Drona&amp;rsquo;s offensive.&#xA;Bhima and his son Ghatotkacha attacked&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s division and in that day&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;battle the son appeared to excel his great&#xA;father in valor.&#xA;Bhima&amp;rsquo;s shafts hit Duryodhana and he lay&#xA;in swoon in his chariot. His charioteer&#xA;quickly drove the chariot away from the&#xA;scene. He feared that the Kaurava forces&#xA;would be completely demoralised if they&#xA;saw that the prince had been disabled.&#xA;But even this movement created great&#xA;confusion. Bhimasena took full advantage&#xA;of the position and worked havoc among&#xA;the fleeing Kaurava forces.&#xA;Drona and Bhishma who saw the&#xA;discomfiture and confusion of the&#xA;Kaurava army came up quickly and&#xA;restored confidence. The scattered forces&#xA;were brought together and Duryodhana&#xA;was again seen leading them.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;How can you stand thus,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Duryodhana to the grandsire, &amp;ldquo;looking on&#xA;when our forces are scattered and put to&#xA;disgraceful flight? I fear you are too kind&#xA;to the Pandavas. Why did you not tell me&#xA;frankly&#xA;&amp;lsquo;I&#xA;love&#xA;the&#xA;Pandavas;&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna and Satyaki are my&#xA;friends and I cannot attack or slay them.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;You should have stated the position&#xA;explicitly to me. Surely these men are not&#xA;equal to you. And if you were so minded,&#xA;you could deal with them easily. Even&#xA;now, it would be best if you and Drona&#xA;told me frankly your mind in the matter.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The chagrin of defeat, and the knowledge&#xA;that the grandsire disapproved of his ways&#xA;made Duryodhana speak thus bitterly. But&#xA;Bhishma merely smiled and said: &amp;ldquo;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;I quite frank in my advice to you? That&#xA;advice you rejected when you decided on&#xA;war. I tried to prevent the war but, now&#xA;that it has come, I am fulfilling my duties&#xA;by you with all my might. I am an old&#xA;man and what I am doing is quite my&#xA;utmost.&amp;ldquo;Saying thus, the grandsire resumed his&#xA;operations. The turn of events in the&#xA;forenoon had been so much in their favor&#xA;that the delighted Pandavas were now&#xA;somewhat careless.&#xA;They did not expect Bhishma to rally his&#xA;forces and attack them again. But stung by&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s reproaches, the grandsire&#xA;raged about the field like a destroying fire.&#xA;He rallied his men and delivered the most&#xA;severe attack yet made on the Pandava&#xA;army. The latter thought that the grandsire&#xA;had multiplied himself into a number of&#xA;Bhishmas fighting at several points. So&#xA;swift were his movements that afternoon.&#xA;Those who opposed him were struck&#xA;down and perished like months in the fire.&#xA;The Pandava army was thoroughly broken&#xA;and began to scatter. Vasudeva, Partha&#xA;and Sikhandin tried hard to restore order&#xA;and confidence, but were unsuccessful.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dhanjaya,&amp;rdquo; said Krishna, &amp;ldquo;now has the&#xA;critical time come. Be true to your&#xA;decision not to flinch from your duty to&#xA;kill in battle Bhishma, Drona and all the&#xA;other friends and relatives and respected&#xA;elders. You have pledged yourself to it&#xA;and you have now to carry it out.&#xA;Otherwise our army is lost beyond&#xA;redemption. You must now attack the&#xA;grandsire.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Drive on,&amp;rdquo; said Arjuna.&#xA;As Dhananjaya&amp;rsquo;s chariot sped on towards&#xA;Bhishma, it met a hot reception from the&#xA;grandsire, who covered it with his arrows.&#xA;But, Arjuna bent his bow and discharged&#xA;three shafts that broke the grandsire&amp;rsquo;s bow.&#xA;Bhishma picked up another bow but it too&#xA;met the same fate. The grandsire&amp;rsquo;s heart&#xA;was gladdened when he saw Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s skill&#xA;in archery.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Hail, brave warrior!&amp;rdquo; applauded the&#xA;grandsire, even as, taking up another bow;&#xA;he poured shafts on Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s chariot with&#xA;unerring aim.&#xA;Krishna was not happy at the way Arjuna&#xA;met the attack. The grandsire&amp;rsquo;s bow was&#xA;working fiercely. But Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s hands did&#xA;not do their best, for his heart was not in&#xA;it.&#xA;He had too much regard for his great&#xA;grandsire. Krishna thought that, if Arjuna&#xA;went on like this, the army, which had&#xA;been so badly demoralized already, would&#xA;be utterly destroyed and all would be lost.&#xA;Krishna managed the chariot skilfully, but&#xA;in spite of it, both he and Arjuna were hit&#xA;many times by Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s arrows.&#xA;Janardana&amp;rsquo;s (Krishna) anger rose. &amp;ldquo;I can&#xA;stand this no longer, Arjuna. I shall kill&#xA;Bhishma myself if you will not do it!&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;exclaimed, and dropping the reins, he took&#xA;up his discus and jumped down from the&#xA;chariot and dashed forward towards&#xA;Bhishma.&#xA;Bhishma was far from being perturbed at&#xA;this. On the contrary, his face expanded&#xA;with ecstatic joy. &amp;ldquo;Come, come, Oh Lotus-&#xA;eyed One!&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I bow to you, Oh Madhava. Lord of the&#xA;World, have you indeed come down from&#xA;the chariot for my sake? I offer you my&#xA;life. If I be slain by you, I shall be&#xA;glorified in the three worlds. Give me that&#xA;boon. May your hands take this life away&#xA;and save me for eternity.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna was distressed to see this. He&#xA;jumped down and ran after Krishna.&#xA;Overtaking him with great difficulty, he&#xA;entreated Krishna to turn back.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do not lose your patience with me.&#xA;Desist and I promise not to flinch,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;said, and persuaded Krishna to return. The&#xA;chariot reins were again in Krishna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;hands. Arjuna attacked the Kaurava forces&#xA;furiously and thousands were slain by&#xA;him.&#xA;The Kauravas suffered a severe defeat on&#xA;the evening of the third day. As they&#xA;returned to their camps in torchlight, they&#xA;said to one another: &amp;ldquo;Who can equalArjuna? There is nothing strange in his&#xA;being victorious.&amp;rdquo; So marvelous was&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s prowess that day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE battle was very much the same every&#xA;day and the narrative is one of&#xA;monotonous fighting and killing. Still, the&#xA;great battle is the central event in the&#xA;Mahabharata and, if we skip over it, we&#xA;cannot fully understand the epic heroes of&#xA;that crowded stage.&#xA;At break of day, Bhishma arrayed the&#xA;Kaurava forces again. Surrounded by&#xA;Drona, Duryodhana and others, the&#xA;grandsire looked verily like great Indra,&#xA;holding his thunder bolt, surrounded by&#xA;the devas.&#xA;The Kaurava army, with its chariots,&#xA;elephants and horses all arrayed in battle&#xA;order and ready for the fight, presented&#xA;the appearance of the sky in a great&#xA;thunderstorm.&#xA;The grandsire gave orders for advance.&#xA;Arjuna watched the hostile movements&#xA;from his chariot, whereon the Hanuman&#xA;flag was waving, and he too got ready.&#xA;The battle commenced. Aswatthama,&#xA;Bhurisravas, Salya, Chitrasena and the son&#xA;of Chala surrounded Abhimanyu and&#xA;attacked him. The warrior fought like a&#xA;lion opposing five elephants.&#xA;Arjuna saw this combined attack on his&#xA;son and, with a wrathful lion roar joined&#xA;his son whereat the tempo of fighting&#xA;flared up. Dhrishtadyumna also arrived&#xA;with a large force. The son of Chala was&#xA;killed.&#xA;Chala himself now joined and he with&#xA;Salya, made a strong attack on&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna. The latter&amp;rsquo;s bow was&#xA;severed into two by a sharp missile&#xA;discharged by Salya.&#xA;Abhimanyu saw this and sent a shower of&#xA;arrows on Salya and put him in such&#xA;danger that Duryodhana and his brothers&#xA;rushed to Salya&amp;rsquo;s help. Bhimasena also&#xA;appeared on the scene at this juncture.&#xA;When Bhima raised his mace aloft,&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s brothers lost courage.&#xA;Duryodhana,&#xA;who&#xA;saw&#xA;this,&#xA;was&#xA;exceedingly&#xA;angry&#xA;and&#xA;immediately&#xA;charged against Bhima with a large force&#xA;of elephants.&#xA;As soon as Bhima saw the elephants&#xA;coming up, he descended from his chariot,&#xA;iron mace in hand, attacked them so&#xA;fiercely that they scattered in a wild&#xA;stampede, throwing the Kaurava ranks&#xA;into disorder.&#xA;It will be seen that even in our Puranic&#xA;stories elephants fared as badly in battle as&#xA;they did in the wars of the Greeks and the&#xA;Romans. Bhima&amp;rsquo;s attack on the elephants&#xA;was like Indra&amp;rsquo;s devastating onslaught on&#xA;the winged mountains.&#xA;The slaughtered elephants lay dead on the&#xA;field like great hills. Those that escaped&#xA;fled in panic and caused great havoc in the&#xA;Kaurava&#xA;army,&#xA;trampling&#xA;numerous&#xA;soldiers in their wild race. Duryodhana,&#xA;thereupon, ordered a wholesale attack on&#xA;Bhima.&#xA;But he stood firm as a rock and presently,&#xA;the Pandava warriors came up and joined&#xA;him. A number of Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s arrows&#xA;struck Bhima&amp;rsquo;s chest and he climbed up&#xA;his chariot again.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Visoka, now is the glad hour,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Bhima to his charioteer. &amp;ldquo;I see a number&#xA;of Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s sons before me, ready to&#xA;be shaken down like ripe fruits on a tree.&#xA;Keep your hold well on the reins and&#xA;drive on. I am going to dispatch these&#xA;wretches to Yama&amp;rsquo;s abode.&amp;rdquo; Bhima&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;arrows would have killed Duryodhana&#xA;then and there, had it not been for his&#xA;armor.&#xA;Eight of Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s brothers were slain&#xA;in that day&amp;rsquo;s battle by Bhima. Duryodhana&#xA;fought fiercely. Bhima&amp;rsquo;s bow was&#xA;smashed by one of Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s arrows.Taking up a fresh bow, Bhima sent an&#xA;arrow with a knife-edge at Duryodhana&#xA;that cut the latter&amp;rsquo;s bow into two.&#xA;Not baffled by this, Duryodhana took up a&#xA;fresh bow and discharged a well-aimed&#xA;shaft which struck Bhima on his chest&#xA;with such force that he reeled and sat&#xA;down.&#xA;The Pandava warriors now poured a great&#xA;shower of arrows on Duryodhana.&#xA;Ghatotkacha, who saw his father sit dazed&#xA;with the force of the blow, got&#xA;exceedingly angry and fell on the Kaurava&#xA;army, which was unable to stand against&#xA;his onslaught.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We cannot fight this Rakshasa today.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Bhishma to Drona. &amp;ldquo;Our men are&#xA;weary. It is nearing sunset and at night of&#xA;the Rakshasas grows stronger with the&#xA;darkness. Let us deal with Ghatotkacha&#xA;tomorrow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The grandsire ordered his army to retire&#xA;for the night. Duryodhana sat musing in&#xA;his tent, his eyes filled with tears. He had&#xA;lost many of his brothers in that day&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;battle.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sanjaya,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;exclaimed&#xA;Dhritarashtra.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Every day, you give me nothing but bad&#xA;news. Your tale has ever been one of&#xA;sorrow, of defeat and loss of dear ones! I&#xA;cannot stand this any more. What&#xA;stratagem can save my people? How are&#xA;we going to win in this fight? Indeed, I am&#xA;full of fear. It seems fate is more powerful&#xA;than human effort.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;King &amp;quot; said Sanjaya in reply, &amp;ldquo;is this not&#xA;all the result of your own folly? Of what&#xA;avail is grief? How can I manufacture&#xA;good news for you? You should hear the&#xA;truth with fortitude.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ah! Vidura&amp;rsquo;s words are coming true,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said the blind old king, plunged in great&#xA;grief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I AM like a shipwrecked man seeking to&#xA;save himself by swimming in a storm&#xA;tossed ocean. I shall surely drown,&#xA;overwhelmed in this sea of sorrow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Again and again, when Sanjaya related the&#xA;happenings&#xA;of&#xA;the&#xA;great&#xA;battle,&#xA;Dhritarashtra would thus lament, unable&#xA;to bear his grief.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Bhima is going to kill all my sons,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;said. &amp;ldquo;I do not believe there is anyone with&#xA;prowess enough in our army to protect my&#xA;sons from death. Did Bhishma, Drona,&#xA;Kripa&#xA;and&#xA;Aswatthama&#xA;look&#xA;on&#xA;unconcerned when our army fled in&#xA;terror? What indeed is their plan? When&#xA;and how are they going to help&#xA;Duryodhana? How are my sons to escape&#xA;from destruction?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying thus, the blind old king burst into&#xA;tears.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Calm yourself, King,&amp;rdquo; said Sanjaya. &amp;ldquo;The&#xA;Pandavas rest on the strength of a just&#xA;cause. So, they win. Your sons are brave&#xA;but their thoughts are wicked. Therefore,&#xA;luck does not favor them. They have done&#xA;great injustice to the Pandavas, and they&#xA;are reaping the harvest of their sins. The&#xA;Pandavas are not winning by charms or&#xA;magic incantations. They are fighting&#xA;according to the practice of kshatriyas.&#xA;Their cause being just, they have strength.&#xA;Friends advised you, but you discarded&#xA;wise counsel. Vidura, Bhishma, Drona&#xA;and I tried to stop you in your unwise&#xA;course, but you did not listen and you&#xA;went on. Like a foolish sick man who&#xA;refuses to drink bitter medicine, you&#xA;obstinately refused to follow our advice,&#xA;which would have saved your people,&#xA;preferring to do as your foolish son&#xA;desired. You are in distress now. Last&#xA;night, Duryodhana asked Bhishma the&#xA;same question as you put to me now. And&#xA;Bhishma gave the same answer as I give&#xA;you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When the fighting was stopped on the&#xA;evening of the fourth day, Duryodhanawent by himself to Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s tent and,&#xA;bowing reverently, said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Grandsire, the world knows that you are&#xA;a warrior who knows not fear. The same is&#xA;the case with Drona, Kripa, Aswatthama,&#xA;Kritavarma,&#xA;Sudakshin,&#xA;Bhurisravas,&#xA;Vikarna and Bhagadatta. Death has no&#xA;terror for these veterans. There is no&#xA;doubt, the prowess of these great warriors&#xA;is limitless, even like your own. All the&#xA;Pandavas combined cannot defeat any one&#xA;of you. What then is the mystery behind&#xA;this daily defeat of our army at the hands&#xA;of the sons of Kunti?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhishma replied: &amp;ldquo;Prince, listen to me. I&#xA;have given you advice on every occasion&#xA;and told you what was good for you. But,&#xA;you have always refused to follow what&#xA;your elders counselled you to do. Again, I&#xA;tell you that it is best for you to make&#xA;peace with Pandu&amp;rsquo;s sons. For your good as&#xA;well as for that of the world, that is the&#xA;only course that should be followed.&#xA;Belonging to the same royal house, you&#xA;can all enjoy this vast country as yours. I&#xA;gave you this advice, but you disregarded&#xA;it and have grievously wronged the&#xA;Pandavas, the fruit of which you are now&#xA;reaping. The Pandavas are protected by&#xA;Krishna himself. How then can you hope&#xA;for victory? Even now, it is not loo late&#xA;for making peace and that is the way to&#xA;rule your kingdom, making the Pandavas,&#xA;your powerful brothers, friends instead of&#xA;enemies. Destruction awaits you if you&#xA;insult Dhananjaya and Krishna, who are&#xA;none other than Nara and Narayana.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana took leave and went to his&#xA;tent, but he could not sleep that night.&#xA;The battle was resumed the next morning.&#xA;Bhishma arrayed the Kaurava forces in a&#xA;strong formation. So did Dhrishtadyumna&#xA;for the Pandava army.&#xA;Bhima stood at the head of the advance&#xA;lines&#xA;as&#xA;usual.&#xA;And&#xA;Sikhandin,&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna&#xA;and&#xA;Satyaki&#xA;stood&#xA;behind, securely guarding the main body,&#xA;aided by other generals.&#xA;Dharmaputra and the twin brothers held&#xA;the rear. Bhishma bent his bow and&#xA;discharged his shafts. The Pandava army&#xA;suffered greatly under the grandsire&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;attack.&#xA;Dhananjaya saw this and retaliated by&#xA;fierce&#xA;shafts&#xA;aimed&#xA;at&#xA;Bhishma.&#xA;Duryodhana&#xA;went&#xA;to&#xA;Drona&#xA;and&#xA;complained bitterly according to his&#xA;custom.&#xA;Drona upbraided him severely: &amp;ldquo;Obstinate&#xA;prince, you talk without understanding.&#xA;You are ignorant of the Pandavas&#39;&#xA;strength. We are doing our best.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Drona&amp;rsquo;s powerful attack on the Pandava&#xA;army was too much for Satyaki who was&#xA;meeting it and Bhima therefore turned his&#xA;attentions to Drona. The battle grew&#xA;fiercer still. Drona, Bhishma and Salya&#xA;made a combined attack on Bhima.&#xA;Sikhandin supported Bhima by pouring a&#xA;shower of arrows on Bhishma. As soon as&#xA;Sikhandin stepped in, Bhishma turned&#xA;away. For Sikhandin was born a girl, and&#xA;Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s principles did not permit him to&#xA;attack a woman.&#xA;In the end, this same objection proved to&#xA;be the cause of Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s death. When&#xA;Drona saw Bhishma turn away, he&#xA;attacked Sikhandin fiercely and compelled&#xA;him to withdraw.&#xA;There was a promiscuous battle the whole&#xA;of the morning of the fifth day, and the&#xA;slaughter was terrific. In the after noon,&#xA;Duryodhana sent a large force to oppose&#xA;Satyaki.&#xA;But Satyaki destroyed it completely and&#xA;advanced&#xA;to&#xA;attack&#xA;Bhurisravas.&#xA;Bhurisravas, who was a powerful&#xA;opponent, put Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s men to fight, and&#xA;pressed Satyaki himself so fiercely that he&#xA;was in distress.&#xA;Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s ten sons saw their father&amp;rsquo;s plight&#xA;and sought to relieve him by launching anoffensive&#xA;against&#xA;Bhurisravas,&#xA;but&#xA;Bhurisravas undaunted by numbers,&#xA;opposed the combined attack and was not&#xA;to be shaken. His well-aimed darts broke&#xA;their weapons and they were all slain,&#xA;strewn on the field like so many tall trees&#xA;struck down by lightning. Satyaki, wild&#xA;with rage and grief, drove forward at a&#xA;furious pace to slay Bhurisravas.&#xA;The chariots of the two warriors dashed&#xA;against each other and crumbled to pieces.&#xA;And the warriors stood face to face with&#xA;sword and shield in desperate single&#xA;combat.&#xA;Then, Bhima came and took away Satyaki&#xA;by force into his chariot and drove away.&#xA;For Bhima knew that Bhurisravas was an&#xA;unrivalled swordsman and he did not want&#xA;Satyaki to be slain.&#xA;Arjuna killed thousands of warriors that&#xA;evening. The soldiers, dispatched against&#xA;him by Duryodhana, perished like moths&#xA;in the fire. As the sun went down and&#xA;Bhishma gave orders to cease fighting, the&#xA;princes on the Pandava army surrounded&#xA;Arjuna and greeted him with loud cries of&#xA;admiration and victory.&#xA;The armies on both sides retired to camp,&#xA;along with the tired horses and elephants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ACCORDING to Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s order&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna arrayed the Pandava&#xA;army in makara (fish) formation for the&#xA;sixth day&amp;rsquo;s battle. The Kaurava army was&#xA;arrayed in krauncha (heron) formation.&#xA;We know, how, similarly, names were&#xA;given to physical exercise, asanas, or&#xA;postures. Vyuha was the general name for&#xA;battle array. Which Vyuha was best for&#xA;any particular occasion, depended on the&#xA;requirements of the offensive and&#xA;defensive plans of the day.&#xA;What the strength and composition of the&#xA;forces arrayed should be and what&#xA;positions they should take up were&#xA;decided upon, according to the situation as&#xA;it developed from time to time.&#xA;The sixth day was marked by a prodigious&#xA;slaughter, even in the first part of the&#xA;morning. Drona&amp;rsquo;s charioteer was killed&#xA;and Drona took the reins of the horses&#xA;himself and used his bow as well.&#xA;Great was the destruction he effected. He&#xA;went about like fire among cotton heaps.&#xA;The formations of both armies were soon&#xA;broken and indiscriminate and fierce&#xA;fighting went on. Blood flowed in torrents&#xA;and the field was covered by dead bodies&#xA;of soldiers, elephants and horses and the&#xA;debris of chariots.&#xA;Bhimasena pierced the enemy&amp;rsquo;s lines to&#xA;seek out Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s brothers and finish&#xA;them. They, for their part, did not wait to&#xA;be sought, but rushed on him, in a&#xA;combined attack from all sides. He was&#xA;attacked by Duhsasana, Durvishaha,&#xA;Durmata, Jaya, Jayatsena, Vikarna,&#xA;Chitrasena,&#xA;Sudarsana,&#xA;Charuchitra,&#xA;Suvarma, Dushkarna and others, all&#xA;together.&#xA;Bhimasena, who did not know what fear&#xA;was, stood up and fought them all. They&#xA;desired to take him prisoner and he to kill&#xA;them all on the spot.&#xA;The battle raged fiercely, even like the&#xA;ancient battle between the gods and the&#xA;asuras. Suddenly, the son of Pandu lost his&#xA;patience and jumped down from his&#xA;chariot, mace in band, and made straight&#xA;on foot for the sons of Dhritarashtra, in&#xA;hot haste to slay them.&#xA;When Dhrishtadyumna saw Bhima&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot disappear in the enemy lines, he&#xA;was alarmed and rushed to prevent&#xA;disaster. He reached Bhima&amp;rsquo;s car, but&#xA;found it was occupied only by the&#xA;charioteer and Bhima was not in it. With&#xA;tears in his eyes, he asked the charioteer:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Visoka, where is Bhima dearer to me&#xA;than life?&amp;rdquo; Dhrishtadyumna naturally&#xA;thought Bhima had fallen.Visoka bowed and said to the son of&#xA;Drupada: &amp;ldquo;The son of Pandu asked me to&#xA;stay here and, without waiting for my&#xA;reply rushed forward on foot, mace in&#xA;hand, into the enemy ranks.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Fearing&#xA;that&#xA;Bhima&#xA;would&#xA;be&#xA;overpowered and killed Dhrishtadyumna&#xA;drove his chariot into the enemy lines in&#xA;search of Bhimasena, whose path was&#xA;marked by the bodies of slain elephants.&#xA;When Dhrishtadyumna found Bhima, he&#xA;saw him surrounded on all sides by&#xA;enemies fighting from their chariots.&#xA;Bhima stood against them all, mace in&#xA;hand, wounded all over and breathing fire.&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna embraced him and took&#xA;him into his chariot and proceeded to pick&#xA;out the shafts that had stuck in his body.&#xA;Duryodhana now ordered his warriors to&#xA;attack Bhimasena and Dhrishtadyumna&#xA;and not to wait for them to attack or&#xA;challenge.&#xA;Accordingly, they made a combined&#xA;attack even though they were not inclined&#xA;to engage themselves in further fighting.&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna had a secret weapon,&#xA;which he had obtained from Dronacharya&#xA;and, discharging it, threw the enemy&#xA;forces into a stupor.&#xA;But Duryodhana then joined the fray and&#xA;discharged weapons to counter the stupor&#xA;weapons of Dhrishtadyumna. Just then,&#xA;reinforcements sent by Yudhishthira&#xA;arrived.&#xA;A force of twelve chariots with their&#xA;retinue led by Abhimanyu came upon the&#xA;scene to support Bhima.&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna was greatly relieved&#xA;when he saw this. Bhimasena had also by&#xA;now refreshed himself and was ready to&#xA;renew the fight. He got into Kekaya&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot and took up his position along&#xA;with the rest.&#xA;Drona, however, was terrible that day. He&#xA;killed Dhrishtadyumna&amp;rsquo;s charioteer and&#xA;horses and smashed his chariot and&#xA;Drupada&amp;rsquo;s son had to seek a place in&#xA;Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s car. The Pandava forces&#xA;began to waver and Drona was cheered by&#xA;the Kaurava army.&#xA;Indiscriminate mass fighting and slaughter&#xA;went on that day. At one time, Bhima and&#xA;Duryodhana met face to face. The usual&#xA;exchange of hot words took place and was&#xA;followed by a great battle of archery.&#xA;Duryodhana was hit and fell unconscious.&#xA;Kripa extricated him with great skill and&#xA;took him away in his own chariot.&#xA;Bhishma personally arrived at the spot&#xA;now and led the attack and scattered the&#xA;Pandava forces.&#xA;The sun was sinking, but the battle was&#xA;continued for an hour yet and the fighting&#xA;was fierce and many thousands perished.&#xA;Then the day&amp;rsquo;s battle ceased. Yudhishthira&#xA;was glad that Dhrishtadyumna and Bhima&#xA;returned to camp alive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DURYODHANA, wounded all over and&#xA;suffering greatly, went to Bhishma and&#xA;said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The battle had been going against us&#xA;every day. Our formations are broken and&#xA;our warriors are being slain in large&#xA;numbers. You are looking on doing&#xA;nothing.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The grandsire soothed Duryodhana with&#xA;comforting words:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why do you let yourself be disheartened?&#xA;Here are all of us, Drona, Salya,&#xA;Kritavarma,&#xA;Aswatthama,&#xA;Vikarna,&#xA;Bhagadatta, Sakuni, the two brothers of&#xA;Avanti, the Trigarta chief, the king of&#xA;Magadha, and Kripacharya. When these&#xA;great warriors are here, ready to give up&#xA;their lives for you, why should you feel&#xA;downhearted? Get rid of this mood of&#xA;dejection.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying this, he issued orders for the day.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;See there,&amp;rdquo; the grandsire said to&#xA;Duryodhana. &amp;ldquo;These thousands of cars,&#xA;horses and horsemen, great war elephants,and those armed foot soldiers from&#xA;various kingdoms are all ready to fight for&#xA;you. With this fine army, you can&#xA;vanquish even the gods. Fear not.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus&#xA;cheering&#xA;up&#xA;the&#xA;dejected&#xA;Duryodhana, he gave him a healing balm&#xA;for his wounds. Duryodhana rubbed it&#xA;over his numerous wounds and felt&#xA;relieved.&#xA;He went to the field, heartened by the&#xA;grandsire&amp;rsquo;s words of confidence. The army&#xA;was that day arrayed in circular formation.&#xA;With each war elephant were seven&#xA;chariots fully equipped.&#xA;Each chariot was supported by seven&#xA;horsemen. To each horseman were&#xA;attached ten shield bearers. Everyone&#xA;wore armor.&#xA;Duryodhana stood resplendent like Indra&#xA;at the center of this great and well-&#xA;equipped army. Yudhishthira arrayed the&#xA;Pandava army in vajravyuha. This day&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;battle was fiercely fought simultaneously&#xA;at many sectors.&#xA;Bhishma personally opposed Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;attacks. Drona and Virata were engaged&#xA;with each other at another point.&#xA;Sikhandin and Aswatthama fought a big&#xA;battle at another sector.&#xA;Duryodhana and Dhrishtadyumna fought&#xA;with each other at yet another point.&#xA;Nakula and Sahadeva attacked their uncle&#xA;Salya. The Avanti kings opposed&#xA;Yudhamanyu, while Bhimasena opposed&#xA;Kritavarma, Chitrasena, Vikarna and&#xA;Durmarsha.&#xA;There were great battles between&#xA;Ghatotkacha and Bhagadatta, between&#xA;Alambasa&#xA;and&#xA;Satyaki,&#xA;between&#xA;Bhurisravas and Dhrishtaketu, between&#xA;Yudhishthira and Srutayu and between&#xA;Chekitana and Kripa.&#xA;In the battle between Drona and Virata,&#xA;the latter was worsted and he had to climb&#xA;into the chariot of his son Sanga, having&#xA;lost his own chariot, horses and&#xA;charioteer.&#xA;Virata&amp;rsquo;s sons Uttara and Sveta had fallen&#xA;in the first day&amp;rsquo;s battle. On this seventh&#xA;day, Sanga also was slain just as his father&#xA;came up to his side. Sikhandin, Drupada&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;son, was defeated by Aswatthama.&#xA;His chariot was smashed and he jumped&#xA;down and stood sword and shield in hand.&#xA;Aswatthama aimed his shaft at his sword&#xA;and broke it. Sikhandin then whirled the&#xA;broken sword and hurled it at Aswatthama&#xA;with tremendous force, but it was met by&#xA;Aswatthama&amp;rsquo;s arrow.&#xA;Sikhandin, badly beaten, got into Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot and retired. In the fight between&#xA;Satyaki and Alambasa, the former had the&#xA;worst of it at first but later recovered&#xA;ground and Alambasa had to flee.&#xA;In the battle between Dhrishtadyumna and&#xA;Duryodhana, the horses of the latter were&#xA;killed and he had to alight from his&#xA;chariot. He, however, continued the fight,&#xA;sword in hand. Sakuni came then and took&#xA;the prince away in his chariot.&#xA;Kritavarma made a strong attack on&#xA;Bhima but was worsted. He lost his&#xA;chariot and horses and acknowledging&#xA;defeat, fled towards Sakuni&amp;rsquo;s car, with&#xA;Bhima&amp;rsquo;s arrows sticking all over him,&#xA;making him look like a porcupine&#xA;speeding away in the forest.&#xA;Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti were&#xA;defeated by Yudhamanyu, and their&#xA;armies&#xA;were&#xA;completely&#xA;destroyed.&#xA;Bhagadatta attacked Ghatotkacha and put&#xA;to flight all his supporters.&#xA;But, alone, Ghatotkacha stood and fought&#xA;bravely. But in the end, he too had to save&#xA;himself by flight, which gladdened the&#xA;whole Kaurava army.&#xA;Salya attacked his nephews. Nakula&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;horses were killed and he had to join his&#xA;brother in the latter&amp;rsquo;s chariot. Both&#xA;continued the fight from the same car.&#xA;Salya was hit by Sahadeva&amp;rsquo;s arrow andswooned. The charioteer skilfully drove&#xA;the car away and saved Salya.&#xA;When the Madra king (Salya) was seen&#xA;retreating from the field Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;army lost heart and the twin sons of Madri&#xA;blew their conchs in triumph. Taking&#xA;advantage of the situation, they inflicted&#xA;heavy damage on Salya&amp;rsquo;s forces.&#xA;At noon, Yudhishthira led an attack on&#xA;Srutayu. The latter&amp;rsquo;s well-aimed arrows&#xA;intercepted Dharmaputra&amp;rsquo;s missiles, and&#xA;his armor was pierced and he was severely&#xA;wounded.&#xA;Yudhishthira then lost his temper and sent&#xA;a powerful arrow that pierced Srutayu&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;breast-plate. That day, Yudhishthira was&#xA;not his normal self and burnt with anger.&#xA;Srutayu&amp;rsquo;s charioteer and horses were&#xA;killed and the chariot was smashed and he&#xA;had to flee on foot from the field. This&#xA;completed&#xA;the&#xA;demorahsation&#xA;of&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s army.&#xA;In the attack on Kripa, Chekitana, losing&#xA;his chariot and charioteer, alighted and&#xA;attacked Kripa&amp;rsquo;s charioteer and horses&#xA;with mace in hand and killed them.&#xA;Kripa also alighted, and standing on the&#xA;ground, discharged his arrows. Chekitana&#xA;was badly hit. He then whirled his mace&#xA;and hurled it at Kripacharya, but the latter&#xA;was able to intercept it with his own&#xA;arrow.&#xA;Thereupon they closed with each other,&#xA;sword in hand. Both were wounded and&#xA;fell on the ground, when Bhima came and&#xA;took Chekitana away in his chariot.&#xA;Sakuni similarly took wounded Kripa&#xA;away in his car.&#xA;Ninety-six arrows of Dhrishtaketu struck&#xA;Bhurisravas. And the great warrior was&#xA;like a sun radiating glory, as the arrows,&#xA;all sticking in his breast-plate, shone&#xA;bright around his radiant face. Even in&#xA;that condition, he compelled Dhrishtaketu&#xA;to admit defeat and retire.&#xA;Three of&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;brothers&#xA;attacked&#xA;Abhimanyu who inflicted a heavy defeat&#xA;on them but spared their lives, because&#xA;Bhima had sworn to kill them. Thereupon,&#xA;Bhishma attacked Abhimanyu.&#xA;Arjuna saw this and said to his illustrious&#xA;charioteer: &amp;ldquo;Krishna, drive the car towards&#xA;Bhishma.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At that moment, the other Pandavas also&#xA;joined Arjuna. But the grandsire was able&#xA;to hold his own against all five until the&#xA;sunset, and the battle was suspended for&#xA;the day. And the warriors of both sides,&#xA;weary and wounded, retired to their tents&#xA;for rest and for having their injuries&#xA;attended to.&#xA;After this, for an hour, soft music was&#xA;played, soothing the warriors to their rest.&#xA;That hour was spent, says the poet,&#xA;without a word about war or hatred. It was&#xA;an hour of heavenly bliss, and it was a&#xA;glad sight to see. One can see herein what&#xA;the great lesson of the Mahabharata is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN the eighth day dawned, Bhishma&#xA;arrayed his army in tortoise formation.&#xA;Yudhishthira said to Dhrishtadyumna:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;See there, the enemy is in kurma vyuha&#xA;(tortoise formation). You have to answer&#xA;at once with a formation that can break it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna immediately proceeded&#xA;to his task. The Pandava forces were&#xA;arrayed in a three-pronged formation.&#xA;Bhima was at the head of one prong,&#xA;Satyaki of another, and Yudhishthira at&#xA;the crest of the middle division. Our&#xA;ancestors had developed the science of&#xA;war very well.&#xA;It was not reduced to writing but was&#xA;preserved by tradition in the families of&#xA;kshatriyas. Armor and tactics were&#xA;employed suitably to meet the weapons of&#xA;offence and the tactics that the enemy&#xA;used in those days.&#xA;The Kurukshetra battle was fought some&#xA;thousands of years ago. Reading the story&#xA;of the battle in the Mahabharata, weshould not, having the practice and&#xA;incidents of modern warfare in mind,&#xA;reject the Mahabharata narrative as mere&#xA;myth with no relation to fact.&#xA;Only about a century and a half ago, the&#xA;English admiral Nelson fought great sea&#xA;battles and won undying renown.&#xA;The weapons used and the vessels that&#xA;actually took part in Nelson&amp;rsquo;s battles,&#xA;would seem almost weird and even&#xA;ridiculous if compared with those of&#xA;modern naval warfare.&#xA;If a hundred and fifty years can make so&#xA;much difference, we must be prepared for&#xA;very strange things in the procedure and&#xA;events of a period, so long back as that of&#xA;the Mahabharata war.&#xA;Another matter to be kept in mind is that&#xA;we cannot expect, in the books of poets&#xA;and literary writers, accurate or full details&#xA;about weapons and tactics, although the&#xA;narrative may be of battles.&#xA;Military affairs were in ancient times the&#xA;sole concern of the military order, the&#xA;kshatriyas. Their culture and their training&#xA;were entirely their own charge.&#xA;The principles and the secrets of warfare&#xA;and the science and art of the use of&#xA;military weapons were handed down from&#xA;generation to generation by tradition and&#xA;personal instruction.&#xA;There were no military textbooks and&#xA;there was not any place for them in the&#xA;works of poets and rishis. If a modern&#xA;novel deals in some chapters with the&#xA;treatment and cure of a sick person, we&#xA;can not expect to see such details in it as&#xA;might interest a medical man. No author&#xA;would care, even if he were able, to&#xA;include scientific details in his story.&#xA;So, we cannot hope to find in the epic of&#xA;Vyasa, precise details as to what is&#xA;tortoise formation or lotus formation. We&#xA;have no explanation as to how one could,&#xA;by discharging a continuous stream of&#xA;arrows, build a defence around himself or&#xA;intercept and cut missiles in transit, or&#xA;how one could be living when pierced all&#xA;over by arrows, or how far the armor worn&#xA;by the soldiers and officers could protect&#xA;them against missiles or what were the&#xA;ambulance arrangements or how the dead&#xA;were disposed of.&#xA;All these things appertaining to ancient&#xA;war, however interesting, will have to be&#xA;in the realm of the unknown in spite of the&#xA;vivid narrative we have in the&#xA;Mahabharata epic.&#xA;Bhima killed eight of Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s sons&#xA;early in the battle that day. Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;heart lost courage before this. It seemed to&#xA;his friends as if Bhimasena would&#xA;complete his revenge this very day, even&#xA;as he swore in the assembly ball, where&#xA;the great outrage was enacted.&#xA;Arjuna had a great bereavement in this&#xA;day&amp;rsquo;s battle. His dear son Iravan was&#xA;killed. This son of Arjuna by his Naga&#xA;wife had come and joined the Pandava&#xA;forces at Kurukshetra. Duryodhana sent&#xA;his friend, the Rakshasa Alambasa, to&#xA;oppose the Naga warrior.&#xA;Iravan was slain after a fierce fight. When&#xA;Arjuna heard this, he broke down&#xA;completely. Said he turning to Vasudeva:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Vidura had indeed told us plainly that&#xA;both sides would be plunged in grief&#xA;unbearable. What are we doing all this&#xA;wretched destruction up on one another&#xA;for? Just for the sake of property. After all&#xA;this killing, what joy are we or they likely&#xA;to find in the end? O Madhusudana, I now&#xA;see why the far seeing Yudhishthira said&#xA;he would be content if Duryodhana would&#xA;give five villages to us, keeping&#xA;everything else to himself and he would&#xA;not resort to fighting if that were agreed&#xA;to. Duryodhana, in his obstinate folly,&#xA;refused to give even these five villages&#xA;and so, these great sins have to be&#xA;committed on both sides. I continue&#xA;fighting only because men wouldotherwise think me a coward, who could&#xA;submit tamely to wrong. When I see the&#xA;dead warriors lying on the field, my heart&#xA;is filled with unbearable anguish. Oh, how&#xA;wicked we are to carry on in this&#xA;miserable, sinful way.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Seeing Iravan killed, Ghatotkacha uttered&#xA;a loud war-cry which made all the&#xA;assembled soldiers tremble. And with his&#xA;division, he fell upon the Kaurava army&#xA;ferociously. So great was the destruction&#xA;he wrought that at many points the&#xA;Kaurava formation was broken.&#xA;Seeing this, Duryodhana personally led an&#xA;attack on Bhima&amp;rsquo;s son. The king of Vanga&#xA;joined Duryodhana with his elephants.&#xA;Duryodhana fought most bravely on this&#xA;eighth day of the battle. He killed a great&#xA;number of warriors on Ghatotkacha&amp;rsquo;s side.&#xA;Ghatotkacha hurled a javelin which would&#xA;have ended Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s career but for&#xA;the Vanga chief&amp;rsquo;s prompt intervention&#xA;with one of his elephants.&#xA;The missile hit the beast, which fell dead,&#xA;and Duryodhana was saved.&#xA;Bhishma was anxious about Duryodhana&#xA;and sent a large force under Drona to&#xA;support the Kaurava prince.&#xA;Many were the veterans who were in this&#xA;force that attacked Ghatotkacha.&#xA;So tumultuous and fierce was the fight at&#xA;this sector of the battle that Yudhishthira&#xA;feared for Ghatotkacha&amp;rsquo;s safety and sent&#xA;Bhimasena to his aid.&#xA;Then the battle became even fiercer than&#xA;before. Sixteen of Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s brothers&#xA;perished on this day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ON the morning of the ninth day, before&#xA;the battle began, Duryodhana was&#xA;closeted with the grandsire. He gave vent&#xA;to his bitter feelings of disappointment&#xA;over the way the battle was going. He&#xA;uttered words that were like the sharp&#xA;spears and pained the grandsire greatly&#xA;but the latter was patient and said sadly:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Like ghee on the sacrificial fire I am&#xA;pouring my life out for you. Why do you&#xA;seek to mortify me, who have been doing&#xA;my very utmost for you? You speak like a&#xA;man of no understanding, not knowing&#xA;what is right and what is wrong. They say&#xA;that, when a man is nearing his death, the&#xA;tree appears to him to be made of gold.&#xA;You see things now, not as they are. Your&#xA;vision is clouded. You are now reaping&#xA;the harvest of the hatred you deliberately&#xA;sowed. The best course for you are to go&#xA;on fighting, as well as you can. This is&#xA;also the plain path of duty. It is not&#xA;possible for me to fight Sikhandin, for I&#xA;can never raise my hand against a woman.&#xA;Nor can I with my hands kill the&#xA;Pandavas, for my mind revolts against it. I&#xA;will do everything barring these two and&#xA;fight all the warriors opposed to you.&#xA;Nothing is gained by losing heart. Fight as&#xA;a kshatriya should and honor will be yours&#xA;whatever the events.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying thus to Duryodhana and cheering&#xA;him up with wise and affectionate words,&#xA;Bhishma proceeded to issue instructions&#xA;for arraying the forces for the day&amp;rsquo;s battle.&#xA;Duryodhana was heartened. He sent for&#xA;Duhsasana and said to him: &amp;ldquo;Brother, put&#xA;forth all our strength in today&amp;rsquo;s battle. I am&#xA;convinced, the grandsire is fighting on our&#xA;side with his whole heart. It is only&#xA;against Sikhandin, he says, he cannot use&#xA;his weapons. We should see that he is not&#xA;exposed to Sikhandin&amp;rsquo;s attacks, for you&#xA;know, even a wild dog can kill a lion if&#xA;the latter scorns to fight back.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;There was a great fight between&#xA;Abhimanyu and Alambasa. Abhimanyu&#xA;demonstrated that his valor was no less&#xA;than his illustrious father&amp;rsquo;s. Alambasa had&#xA;to flee on foot to save himself.&#xA;There were fierce combats between&#xA;Satyaki and Aswatthama and between&#xA;Drona and Arjuna. Thereafter, all the&#xA;Pandavas attacked the grandsire andDuryodhana sent Duhsasana to support&#xA;the old warrior. Bhishma fought furiously&#xA;and beat the Pandavas back.&#xA;The Pandava forces were thoroughly&#xA;demoralised and were flying hither and&#xA;thither, like cattle that had lost their way&#xA;in the forest.&#xA;Krishna halted the chariot and said to&#xA;Arjuna: &amp;ldquo;Partha, you and your brothers&#xA;were looking forward to this day, after&#xA;thirteen years. Do not hesitate to kill the&#xA;grandsire. Remember the duty of a&#xA;soldier.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna bent his head down and, without&#xA;looking up, replied: &amp;ldquo;I would much rather&#xA;have continued to be an exile in the forest&#xA;than kill the grandsire and the teachers&#xA;whom I love, but I shall obey you. Drive&#xA;on.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s heart was not in the fight.&#xA;Unwillingly and in great distress of mind,&#xA;he proceeded to the combat. Bhishma, on&#xA;the other hand, burnt fiercely like the&#xA;noonday sun.&#xA;When the army saw Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s chariot&#xA;proceed towards Bhishma, it regained&#xA;courage and order once again prevailed.&#xA;Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s arrows came thick and fast and&#xA;covered the advancing chariot so&#xA;completely that neither horses nor&#xA;vehicles could be seen.&#xA;Krishna was unperturbed and drove on&#xA;with circumspection and skill. Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;shafts hit Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s bow and shattered it&#xA;many times. But the grandsire went on&#xA;renewing his weapon.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are not fighting, Arjuna, as you&#xA;should!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Krishna, and jumped&#xA;down in a rage from the chariot and,&#xA;taking up his discus, he advanced towards&#xA;the grandsire.&#xA;Bhishma saw Vasudeva approaching.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Hail, O Lotus-eyed One!&amp;rdquo; he cried.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Blessed am I to be separated from the&#xA;body by you! Come, come!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna jumped down from the chariot&#xA;and, rushing forward overtook and held&#xA;Krishna, casting both his arms around&#xA;him. &amp;ldquo;Stop, Krishna,&amp;rdquo; he cried. &amp;ldquo;Do not&#xA;break your pledge. You have promised not&#xA;to use weapons in this battle. This is my&#xA;work. I shall not fail. I shall send my&#xA;arrows and kill the beloved grandsire&#xA;myself. Pray, mount the car and take the&#xA;reins.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna took Krishna back and the battle&#xA;was resumed. The Pandava forces had&#xA;been handled roughly, but now the sun&#xA;was down in the west and the fighting&#xA;ended for the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IT was the tenth day of the battle. Keeping&#xA;Sikhandin in front of him, Arjuna attacked&#xA;Bhishma. When Sikhandin&amp;rsquo;s darts pierced&#xA;his breast, sparks flew from the grandsire&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;eyes.&#xA;For a moment the old warrior&amp;rsquo;s anger rose&#xA;like flaming fire and his eyes glared as if&#xA;to consume Sikhandin. But, at once, the&#xA;grandsire restrained himself.&#xA;He decided not to be provoked into&#xA;fighting Sikhandin, who was born a&#xA;woman and to strike whom it seemed&#xA;unworthy of a warrior.&#xA;He knew, however, his end was near and&#xA;calmed himself. Sikhandin went on&#xA;discharging his arrows, not minding the&#xA;battle of emotions in his opponent&amp;rsquo;s mind.&#xA;Arjuna also steeled his heart, and from&#xA;behind Sikhandin aimed arrows at the&#xA;weak points in Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s armor, even&#xA;while the grandsire stood still.&#xA;Bhishma smiled as the arrows continued&#xA;to come down thick on him, and turning to&#xA;Duhsasana, said: &amp;ldquo;Ah, these are Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;arrows! These cannot be Sikhandin&amp;rsquo;s, for&#xA;they burn my flesh as the crab&amp;rsquo;s young&#xA;ones tear their mother&amp;rsquo;s body.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus did the grandsire look upon his dear&#xA;pupil&amp;rsquo;s arrows and, while saying this to&#xA;Duhsasana, he took up a javelin andhurled it at Arjuna. Arjuna met it with&#xA;three arrows which cut it to pieces even&#xA;as it was speeding through the air.&#xA;Bhishma then decided to end the combat&#xA;and made as if to dismount from his&#xA;chariot, sword and shield in hand. But&#xA;before he could do so, his shield was cut&#xA;to pieces by Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s arrows.&#xA;With arrows sticking all over his body so&#xA;thickly that there was not even an inch of&#xA;intervening space, Bhishma fell headlong&#xA;to the ground from his chariot.&#xA;As he fell, the gods, who looked on from&#xA;above, folded their hands in reverent&#xA;salutation and a gentle breeze, laden with&#xA;fragrance and cool raindrops, swept over&#xA;the battlefield.&#xA;Thus fell the great and good Bhishma, the&#xA;son of Ganga, who came on earth to&#xA;hallow it and all it bears.&#xA;The blameless hero who, unasked, made&#xA;the great renunciation to give joy to his&#xA;father. The undefeated bowman who had&#xA;humbled the pride of Rama of the axe.&#xA;The selfless worker for righteousness&#39;&#xA;sake, thus repaid his debt to Duryodhana,&#xA;and lay wounded to death sanctifying with&#xA;his life-blood the battlefield. As the&#xA;grandsire fell, the hearts of the Kauravas&#xA;also fell along with him.&#xA;Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s body did not touch the ground,&#xA;on account of the arrows sticking out all&#xA;over his body. His body shone more&#xA;brightly than ever before, as it lay as on a&#xA;bed of honor, supported by the shafts that&#xA;had pierced his flesh.&#xA;Both armies ceased fighting and all the&#xA;warriors came running and crowded round&#xA;the great hero, who lay on his bed of&#xA;arrows. The kings of the earth stood with&#xA;bowed heads round him, as the gods&#xA;round Brahma.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My head hangs down unsupported,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;the grandsire. The princes who stood near,&#xA;ran and brought cushions. The old warrior&#xA;rejected them with a smile and, turning&#xA;towards Arjuna said: &amp;ldquo;Dear son Partha,&#xA;give me a cushion befitting a warrior.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Arjuna, whose arrows were just&#xA;then burning the grandsire&amp;rsquo;s flesh, heard&#xA;those words addressed to him, he took&#xA;three arrows from out of his quiver and so&#xA;placed them that the grandsire&amp;rsquo;s head&#xA;found support on their points.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Princes,&amp;rdquo; said Bhishma addressing the&#xA;assembled chiefs, &amp;ldquo;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s arrows were&#xA;indeed what my head required to be&#xA;supported on. This pillow gives me&#xA;satisfaction. Now, I must lie thus until the&#xA;sun turns north. My soul will not depart&#xA;till then. When I pass away, those of you&#xA;who may be alive then may come and see&#xA;me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then the grandsire turned again to Arjuna&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;I am tormented with thirst. Get&#xA;me some drinking water.&amp;rdquo; At once, Arjuna&#xA;raised his bow, and drawing, it to the ear,&#xA;shot a shaft down into the earth near the&#xA;grandsire on his right side.&#xA;Upon the opening made by the arrow,&#xA;there gushed a stream of pure sweet water&#xA;to the very lips of the dying man. Ganga&#xA;came up, says the poet, to quench her dear&#xA;son&amp;rsquo;s burning thirst. Bhishma drank and&#xA;was happy.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Duryodhana, may you be wise!&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Bhishma, addressing the Kaurava prince.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Did you see how Arjuna brought me&#xA;water to quench my thirst? Who else in&#xA;this world can do such a deed? Make&#xA;peace with him without further delay.&#xA;May the war cease with my exit. Listen to&#xA;me, son, make peace with the Pandavas.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The grandsire&amp;rsquo;s words did not please&#xA;Duryodhana. Even when dying, the&#xA;patient does not like medicine. He objects&#xA;to the bitter taste. All the princes retired to&#xA;their camps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN he learnt that Bhishma lay&#xA;wounded and dying, Karna hurried to the&#xA;place and fell at his feet and said:&amp;ldquo;Eldest of the race. Radha&amp;rsquo;s son, who,&#xA;through no fault of his, incurred your&#xA;great displeasure, humbly prostrates&#xA;himself before you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When after humble salutation Karna stood&#xA;up, the grandsire, greatly moved, tenderly&#xA;placed his hand on Karna&amp;rsquo;s head and&#xA;blessed him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are not Radha&amp;rsquo;s son, young man,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;said in loving tones: &amp;ldquo;You are Kuntidevi&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;own first born. Narada, who knows all the&#xA;secrets of the world, himself revealed this&#xA;to me. Son of Surya, truly I entertained no&#xA;dislike for you. But I was grieved to see&#xA;your increasing hatred of the Pandavas&#xA;although they gave you no cause for it. I&#xA;know and admire your valor and your&#xA;open handedness. And I know also that&#xA;you belong to the class of Phalguna and&#xA;Krishna in prowess. It is proper that you&#xA;befriend the Pandavas. Therein lies the&#xA;right path for you who are their brother.&#xA;With the closing of my part in this war,&#xA;may the chapter of your enmity also close.&#xA;This is my wish, Karna.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Karna listened respectfully and replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Grandsire I know I am Kunti&amp;rsquo;s son, and&#xA;not charioteer born. But I have eaten&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s salt and must be true to&#xA;him, to be true to my own lineage. It is&#xA;impossible for me to go over to the&#xA;Pandavas now. You must permit me to&#xA;repay with my life, if it so be the debt I&#xA;owe to Duryodhana for his love and trust.&#xA;I have erred greatly in word and deed.&#xA;You must forgive me for it all and give&#xA;me your blessings.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The great acharya, who knew all the laws&#xA;of right conduct and what Karna said,&#xA;replied: &amp;ldquo;Do reflect for a while and then&#xA;do as you wish, for that is the right way.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Even when Bhishma was mortally&#xA;wounded and lay dying, the battle did not&#xA;cease. Discarding the grandsire&amp;rsquo;s words of&#xA;wisdom, the Kauravas resumed the battle.&#xA;Deprived of Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s leadership, the&#xA;Kaurava forces felt like sheep without a&#xA;shepherd when Bhishma no longer led&#xA;them. Indeed, even as Bhishma fell&#xA;wounded, the men shouted:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Karna, you are the one left to lead and&#xA;protect us.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Kaurava warriors felt that, if but&#xA;Karna would agree to take up the&#xA;command, victory was certain. During the&#xA;first ten days when Bhishma led the&#xA;forces, the son of Surya kept away from&#xA;the battle.&#xA;As already narrated, deeply hurt at the&#xA;grandsire&amp;rsquo;s contempt, Karna had said: &amp;ldquo;So&#xA;long as you are up fighting, I shall keep&#xA;aloof. If you slay the Pandavas and bring&#xA;victory to Duryodhana, I shall be glad.&#xA;And I shall then, taking the king&amp;rsquo;s leave,&#xA;go to the forest. But, if you be defeated&#xA;and go to the abode of the brave, I who&#xA;am not deemed by you as an adhiratha&#xA;(master of chariot warfare) will ride my&#xA;chariot and oppose those whom you deem&#xA;to be of greater prowess than myself. And&#xA;defeating&#xA;them,&#xA;bring&#xA;victory&#xA;to&#xA;Duryodhana.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus had Karna sworn and, with&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s consent, kept aloof from the&#xA;battle during the first ten days. Now he&#xA;went on foot to Bhishma who lay on his&#xA;bed of arrows waiting for his end and,&#xA;saluting him, addressed him thus:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Veteran&#xA;grandsire,&#xA;vanquisher&#xA;of&#xA;Parasurama, you lie on the field of battle,&#xA;struck down by Sikhandin. If you, who&#xA;had reached the summit of right living and&#xA;were an embodiment of purity itself, must&#xA;lie wounded in this manner, it is clear that&#xA;no one can attain in this world what he&#xA;deserves by his merit. You were the one&#xA;boat on which the Kaurava princes&#xA;depended for crossing the flood of their&#xA;troubles. Heavy indeed will be the blows&#xA;that the Pandavas will now deal at the&#xA;Kauravas and great will be theirconsequent distress. Like fire and wind&#xA;burning down the forest, Arjuna and&#xA;Krishna will destroy the army of&#xA;Kauravas. This is certain. Turn your&#xA;gracious eyes on me and bless me, who&#xA;have accepted the command of the&#xA;forces.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhishma&#xA;gave&#xA;his&#xA;blessings&#xA;to&#xA;Karna.&amp;ldquo;You are like the good earth to the&#xA;seeds, like rain clouds to living beings,&#xA;ever dependable, firm in your loyalty.&#xA;Serve Duryodhana and save him. You&#xA;vanquished the Kambojas for him. You&#xA;put down the Kiratas of the Himalayan&#xA;fastnesses for him. You fought the&#xA;Girivrajas on his behalf and defeated&#xA;them. Many more things you have&#xA;accomplished for him. Take charge of the&#xA;Kaurava army now as your own rich&#xA;possession and guard it well. May you&#xA;lead Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s forces to success! May&#xA;you have every good fortune! Fight your&#xA;enemies, go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Karna, having received the benediction of&#xA;the grandsire, mounted his chariot and&#xA;rode to the battlefield. When the valorous&#xA;Karna entered the field on his war chariot,&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s joys knew no bounds. His&#xA;sorrow, at having lost Bhishma, was in&#xA;some degree alleviated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>075 DRONA IN COMMAND</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DURYODHANA and Karna held counsel&#xA;as to who should be put in supreme&#xA;command of the forces.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Well, everyone of these princely warriors&#xA;fighting on your side is great enough to be&#xA;put in charge of our forces as supreme&#xA;commander,&amp;rdquo; said Karna.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;All these kings are of equal prowess,&#xA;strength, energy, skill, courage, valor,&#xA;ancestry and wisdom. They cannot all be&#xA;put in joint command and, if any of them&#xA;be chosen, each of the others would feel&#xA;hurt and may not put forth his whole&#xA;strength in the cause. Thereby we stand to&#xA;suffer. So, my advice is that we install&#xA;Dronacharya, the teacher of all these&#xA;princes and warriors, as supreme&#xA;commander. He indeed is the greatest of&#xA;all those that carry arms today. No&#xA;kshatriya equals him in the qualities&#xA;required for leading our army. Let us&#xA;therefore install him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana agreed that this was the right&#xA;thing to do, and so it was decided.&#xA;Duryodhana went to Dronacharya and, in&#xA;the presence of the assembled warriors&#xA;and princes, bowed and addressed him:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Revered Master, you are unrivalled&#xA;among all those assembled here in caste,&#xA;ancestry, knowledge of sciences, age,&#xA;wisdom, valor and skill. I beg of you to&#xA;accept the supreme command. Under your&#xA;command, this army will be victorious.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The assembled kings received this&#xA;proposal with loud cheers and war cries&#xA;that gladdened Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s heart.&#xA;Drona was installed in due form amidst&#xA;thunderous acclamation. The praise of&#xA;courtiers and the sound of trumpets that&#xA;accompanied the ceremony, made the&#xA;Kauravas feel as though they had already&#xA;vanquished the enemy. So great was their&#xA;enthusiasm and confidence in Drona&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;leadership.&#xA;Drona arrayed the army in circular&#xA;formation. Karna, who had till then stood&#xA;aside was now seen moving about in his&#xA;great chariot on the battlefield and this put&#xA;new courage and joy into the hearts of the&#xA;Kaurava soldiers.&#xA;The talk went round in the army that the&#xA;great Bhishma did not wish to slay the&#xA;sons of Pandu and therefore had not put&#xA;his whole heart in the fight. But now that&#xA;Karna was in the field, it was certain that&#xA;the Pandavas would be destroyed.&#xA;Dronacharya was in command for five&#xA;days of the battle. Though of advanced&#xA;years, he was everywhere in the field and&#xA;displayed the fierce energy of a young&#xA;warrior. Whenever he led an attack, thePandava forces were scattered like clouds&#xA;before a storm.&#xA;He personally engaged the greatest&#xA;warriors on the Pandava side in battle. He&#xA;fought&#xA;Satyaki,&#xA;Bhima,&#xA;Arjuna,&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna, Abhimanyu, Drupada&#xA;and Kasiraja and defeated them on many&#xA;occasions.&#xA;He harassed and inflicted severe&#xA;punishment on the Pandava army during&#xA;the five days he was in command.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AS SOON AS Drona assumed command&#xA;of the Kaurava forces Duryodhana, Karna&#xA;and Duhsasana sat in council and decided&#xA;on a plan. And Duryodhana went to&#xA;Dronacharya to put it in operation.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Acharya, we desire that you should&#xA;capture Yudhishthira alive and give him&#xA;over to us. We desire nothing more, not&#xA;even a total victory. If you achieve this for&#xA;us, we shall all be exceedingly satisfied&#xA;with your conduct of the war.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Drona heard Duryodhana address&#xA;him thus, great was his joy, for he hated&#xA;the very idea of slaying the Pandava&#xA;brothers. Even though, to fulfil his&#xA;obligation, the acharya loyally joined the&#xA;Kaurava side against the Pandavas, he&#xA;loved the sons of Kunti and especially the&#xA;pure-minded Yudhishthira.&#xA;So, when he heard Duryodhana request&#xA;that Yudhishthira should be captured&#xA;alive, he felt greatly relieved.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Duryodhana, may you be blessed!&amp;rdquo; the&#xA;acharya said. &amp;ldquo;Do you too wish to abstain&#xA;from killing Yudhishthira? How it&#xA;gladdens my heart! Truly, Yudhishthira is&#xA;one without an enemy and the name&#xA;Ajatasatru, which the people have given to&#xA;Kunti&amp;rsquo;s eldest son, has been justified by&#xA;your great decision. When even you have&#xA;made up your mind that he should not be&#xA;killed but should be captured alive, his&#xA;unrivalled glory has become ten times&#xA;enhanced.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I see, dear Duryodhana, what you&#xA;intend,&amp;rdquo; Drona continued. &amp;ldquo;You wish to&#xA;defeat the Pandavas in battle and then give&#xA;them their share in the kingdom and live&#xA;in peace and amity with them. I see this&#xA;clearly from your desire to capture&#xA;Yudhishthira alive.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Drona was exceedingly glad and he said&#xA;again: &amp;ldquo;Indeed Yudhishthira is the most&#xA;fortunate man on earth. The gods are&#xA;showering their favors on Kunti&amp;rsquo;s good&#xA;son. So has he won the hearts of even&#xA;enemies.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s motives in wishing to&#xA;take Yudhishthira alive were far different.&#xA;And as soon as Drona acceded to his&#xA;proposal and gave his pledge that he&#xA;would do his best to capture Yudhishthira,&#xA;he began to reveal his real intentions.&#xA;If Yudhishthira were slain, nothing would&#xA;be gained by it, and the anger of the&#xA;Pandavas would be all the greater. The&#xA;battle would rage more fiercely than&#xA;before. And Duryodhana knew that it&#xA;would only mean the utter defeat of his&#xA;army.&#xA;Even if the fight were to be continued&#xA;relentlessly until both armies were&#xA;destroyed, Krishna would still remain&#xA;alive and he would put either Draupadi or&#xA;Kunti in sovereign possession of the&#xA;kingdom.&#xA;What then was the point in killing&#xA;Yudhishthira? On the other hand, if&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;was&#xA;captured&#xA;alive,&#xA;Duryodhana thought, the war would end&#xA;more speedily and victoriously for the&#xA;Kauravas.&#xA;Thereafter, he could surely play on&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s goodness and his loyalty to&#xA;the traditional code of kshatriya conduct.&#xA;It was pretty certain he could be drawn&#xA;into the battle of dice again and sent to the&#xA;forests once more.Ten days of fighting had demonstrated to&#xA;Duryodhana that further fighting would&#xA;only result in the destruction of the race,&#xA;not the fulfilment of the desires.&#xA;When Duryodhana made his motives clear&#xA;to Drona, the acharya was greatly&#xA;disappointed and he cursed Duryodhana in&#xA;his heart. But whatever the reason for it,&#xA;he was glad that Yudhishthira was not to&#xA;be killed.&#xA;The news that Drona had given a solemn&#xA;assurance to Duryodhana that he would&#xA;take Yudhishthir a prisoner, was carried&#xA;by their spies to the Pandava army.&#xA;The Pandavas knew that, when the&#xA;acharya was determined on something and&#xA;gave his pledged word for executing it, his&#xA;unrivalled eminence in the art of war and&#xA;his valor made it a most serious affair.&#xA;So, they soon got busy and so arrayed the&#xA;forces that Yudhishthira was never left&#xA;unsupported. Whatever movements might&#xA;take place, they always took care to leave&#xA;sufficient protection against any surprise&#xA;attack on Yudhishthira.&#xA;In the first day&amp;rsquo;s battle under the&#xA;leadership of Drona, the acharya amply&#xA;demonstrated his great skill and energy.&#xA;He moved about destroying the Pandava&#xA;forces like a fire burning up dry logs. His&#xA;rapid movements made the Pandava army&#xA;feel as if Drona was everywhere at the&#xA;same time showering arrows like rain and&#xA;converting the battlefield into a stage for&#xA;the dance of the God of Death. He cut the&#xA;Pandava&#xA;army&#xA;in&#xA;twain&#xA;where&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna stood.&#xA;Many were the single combats among&#xA;renowned warriors. There was a fierce&#xA;battle between Sahadeva and Sakuni&#xA;skilled in illusion warfare. When their&#xA;chariots broke, they alighted on the&#xA;ground. And, like two hills sprung to life&#xA;and motion, they struck each other with&#xA;maces and closed with one another in&#xA;single combat. Between Bhima and&#xA;Vivimsati there was a great battle in&#xA;which chariots were broken on both sides.&#xA;Salya fought his nephew Nakula and&#xA;harassed him exceedingly, smiling most&#xA;provokingly all the time. But, in the end,&#xA;Salya had his car smashed and his flag&#xA;brought down, and he withdrew admitting&#xA;defeat.&#xA;Between&#xA;Kripacharya&#xA;and&#xA;Dhrishtaketu there was a battle in which&#xA;the latter was worsted.&#xA;So also was there fierce fighting between&#xA;Satyaki and Kritavarma and between&#xA;Virata and Karna. Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s valor was&#xA;also demonstrated as he fought Paurava,&#xA;Kritavarma, Jayadratha and Salya single-&#xA;handed and made them withdraw.&#xA;Then there was a great combat between&#xA;Salya and Bhimasena in which Salya was&#xA;defeated and made to retire. The Kaurava&#xA;forces began to lose courage and the&#xA;Pandava army, who saw this, attacked the&#xA;Kaurava army with renewed energy and&#xA;broke its ranks.&#xA;When Drona saw this, he decided to&#xA;restore lost morale by leading a straight&#xA;attack on Yudhishthira. His golden chariot&#xA;went forward, drawn by four noble Sindhu&#xA;horses, in the direction of Yudhishthira.&#xA;Yudhishthira answered with barbed&#xA;arrows, feathered with eagle-feathers. But&#xA;Drona did not mind, and advanced at great&#xA;speed. Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s bow was cut down&#xA;and Drona was coming very near.&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna tried to intercept Drona&#xA;but in vain. The whole army shouted:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yudhishthira has been taken!&amp;rdquo; So near&#xA;came Drona.&#xA;Suddenly, then, Arjuna appeared on the&#xA;battlefield, the earth rumbling under the&#xA;wheels of his chariot, as it coursed swiftly&#xA;over the bloody field, over bones and&#xA;bodies lying in heaps. Drona held back,&#xA;for Arjuna had come on the scene. From&#xA;his Gandiva bow issued a continuous&#xA;stream of arrows. No one could see the&#xA;shafts taken out of the quiver or placed inposition. It seemed as if, from out of the&#xA;great bow, an unending flood of arrows&#xA;issued&#xA;without&#xA;intermission.&#xA;The&#xA;battlefield was darkened by flying&#xA;missiles.&#xA;Drona retreated. Yudhishthira was not&#xA;taken. The battle was stopped for the day&#xA;and the Kaurava forces went to their camp&#xA;in chastened mood.&#xA;The Pandava army marched proudly to&#xA;camp and behind them walked Kesava&#xA;(Krishna) and Arjuna conversing. Thus&#xA;closed the eleventh day of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE attempt to capture Yudhishthira alive&#xA;failed.&#xA;Drona&#xA;was&#xA;speaking&#xA;to&#xA;Duryodhana about this. &amp;ldquo;It is clear we&#xA;cannot succeed in our efforts to seize&#xA;Yudhishthira so long as Dhananjaya is&#xA;nearby. It is no want of interest on my&#xA;part. If by some stratagem we could draw&#xA;Arjuna away to some other part of the&#xA;field, I could pierce the Pandava&#xA;formations and capture Yudhishthira. I&#xA;promise to seize him and deliver him to&#xA;you provided he does not flee from the&#xA;battle, renouncing honor. If he does that,&#xA;then also we win indeed, do we not?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The chief of the Trigartadesa who heard&#xA;Drona say this talked it over with his&#xA;brothers, and they made a plan. They&#xA;resolved to take the samsaptaka oath and&#xA;challenge Arjuna to battle and draw him&#xA;away from Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s side.&#xA;Accordingly, together with a large force,&#xA;they gathered, and sat before the fire,&#xA;dressed in matted grass, and went through&#xA;funeral&#xA;gifts&#xA;and&#xA;ceremonies&#xA;for&#xA;themselves as if already dead, and took&#xA;their oath: &amp;ldquo;Not till we have killed&#xA;Dhananjaya will we turn back. If we flee&#xA;in fear from battle, may we be punished as&#xA;for deadly sin!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having adjured themselves thus before the&#xA;sacred fire, they marched south for that&#xA;was the direction of Death, and shouted&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Arjuna!&amp;rdquo; challenging him to battle.&#xA;It was a great suicide squad organized to&#xA;achieve what Drona had pointed out to be&#xA;essential. Arjuna turned to Yudhishthira&#xA;and addressed him thus: &amp;ldquo;King, the&#xA;samsaptakas are calling me to battle. I am&#xA;pledged to accept a challenge thus thrown&#xA;out. Susarma and his men are calling me&#xA;to battle. I shall destroy them all and&#xA;return. Permit me to go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Brother beloved,&amp;rdquo; said Yudhishthira,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;you know Drona&amp;rsquo;s intentions. Keep that&#xA;in mind and do whatever you think fit. He&#xA;has promised Duryodhana to take me&#xA;alive. He is a matchless warrior, brave,&#xA;strong and skilled in, every branch of&#xA;archery. He knows no fatigue and nothing&#xA;escapes his watchful eyes.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;King, here is Satyajit, standing in support&#xA;of you,&amp;rdquo; replied Arjuna. &amp;ldquo;As long as he is&#xA;alive and by you, nothing can happen to&#xA;you.&amp;rdquo; So saying Arjuna asked the&#xA;Panchala prince Satyajit to stand guard by&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s side and marched off like a&#xA;hungry lion to meet the samsaptakas.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;There, Krishna, see the Trigartas&#xA;standing, cheerful under the intoxication&#xA;of their oath, though they know they go to&#xA;certain death. Indeed they are full of the&#xA;exultation of approaching swarga.&amp;rdquo; So&#xA;speaking to his great charioteer, Arjuna&#xA;approached the large samsaptaka force.&#xA;This was the Twelfth Day of the great&#xA;battle. It was a fierce fight. After a time,&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s attack began to tell and the&#xA;Trigartas fell in swathes before him but&#xA;Susarma reminded them of their oath.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Heroes, we have taken our oaths before&#xA;the fire and in the presence of the whole&#xA;army of warriors. Having sworn terrible&#xA;resolves, it is unworthy to flinch. Let us&#xA;not fall into public ridicule.&amp;rdquo; The&#xA;samsaptakas cheered their leader, and&#xA;faced Arjuna with the sublime courage of&#xA;accepted deaths.&amp;ldquo;Hrishikesa, they are resolved on fighting&#xA;to the last. Drive on,&amp;rdquo; said Arjuna.&#xA;Driven&#xA;by&#xA;Madhusudana&#xA;(Krishna)&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s chariot moved like Indra&amp;rsquo;s car in&#xA;the great war of the gods against the&#xA;asuras. It went here and it went there and&#xA;wherever it went, Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s great bow, the&#xA;Gandiva, scattered death among the&#xA;doomed Trigartas.&#xA;The burst of blood in their compct ranks&#xA;was like the burst of Palasa blossoms in a&#xA;springtime forest. The fighting was&#xA;severe. At one time Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s car and&#xA;flagpole were immersed in darkness under&#xA;the downpour of arrows.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Are you alive, Dhananjaya?&amp;rdquo; shouted&#xA;Krishna.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; replied Arjuna, and pulling the&#xA;string of his Gandiva, discharged shafts&#xA;that dispelled the arrow-shower. It was&#xA;like the Rudra dance of dissolution. The&#xA;field was full of severed limbs and&#xA;headless bodies and presented a terrible&#xA;spectacle.&#xA;As Arjuna proceeded to oppose the&#xA;samsaptakas, Drona gave orders for a&#xA;violent assault on the Pandava forces at&#xA;the point where Yudhishthira stood.&#xA;Yudhishthira saw this movement and&#xA;spoke&#xA;to&#xA;the&#xA;Panchala&#xA;prince&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The brahmana is coming to seize me.&#xA;Look after the forces with vigilance.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The son of Drupada did not wait for&#xA;Drona to advance but marched forward in&#xA;his car himself to meet Drona.&#xA;Dronacharya avoided Dhrishtadyumna,&#xA;for well he knew that his death was&#xA;destined to be at his hands and that death&#xA;was not yet due. And he wheeled his&#xA;chariot in another direction where&#xA;Drupada was leading his forces.&#xA;Drupada&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;forces&#xA;suffered&#xA;heavy&#xA;punishment at Drona&amp;rsquo;s hands and blood&#xA;flowed in streams on the battlefield.&#xA;Drona, then, again turned his attention to&#xA;Yudhishthira. The Pandavas stood firm&#xA;and answered Drona&amp;rsquo;s attacks with&#xA;showers of arrows.&#xA;Satyajit made a charge on Drona&amp;rsquo;s car and&#xA;there was a fierce combat in which&#xA;Drona&amp;rsquo;s figure assumed the grimness of&#xA;the Destroyer. Many a warrior was slain&#xA;by him in succession. Vrika, a prince of&#xA;Panchala, as well as Satyajit, fell dead.&#xA;Seeing this, Satanika, son of Virata,&#xA;marched against Drona. In a moment,&#xA;Satanika&amp;rsquo;s severed head rolled on the&#xA;ground with the golden kundalas shining&#xA;in the earlobes.&#xA;Ketama, another chief, followed the attack&#xA;but he too perished. Then, Vasudhana&#xA;rushed forward to stop the advance of&#xA;Drona, but he too fell dead. Yudhamanyu,&#xA;Satyaki, Sikhandin and Uttamaujas who&#xA;came to push Drona back, were repulsed&#xA;and all these great warriors had to retreat.&#xA;Drona was now almost within reach of&#xA;Yudhishthira.&#xA;At that moment, Panchalya, another son&#xA;of Drupada, rushed madly up to stop the&#xA;acharya and fought most desperately. But,&#xA;he too was mortally wounded and fell&#xA;from his chariot like a failing star.&#xA;Then, Duryodhana was delighted and said&#xA;exultingly to Karna:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Radheya, do you see the valor of our&#xA;mighty leader? No more will the Pandavas&#xA;be inclined towards battle. See how their&#xA;army reels under Drona&amp;rsquo;s blows.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Karna shook his head. &amp;ldquo;Do not be so&#xA;confident,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The Pandavas are not&#xA;to be so easily vanquished. They will&#xA;never surrender. The wrongs they have&#xA;undergone are too great to be forgotten.&#xA;You tried to poison and kill them. You&#xA;tried to burn them alive. You have grieved&#xA;and humiliated them at the game of dice&#xA;and you have forced them out to live in&#xA;the forest for long years. They will not&#xA;surrender. See there, their army has rallied&#xA;and all their forces are leading a combinedattack on Drona. There, see Bhima,&#xA;Satyaki, Yudhamanyu, Kshatradharma,&#xA;Nakula, Uttamaujas, Drupada, Virata,&#xA;Sikhandin.&#xA;Dhrishtaketu&#xA;and&#xA;other&#xA;warriors have all come to protect&#xA;Yudhishthira and are pressing Drona hard.&#xA;We should not stand idly watching, when&#xA;we have put such a heavy burden on the&#xA;acharya. Great as he is, there is a limit to&#xA;the load even he can carry. Even wolves&#xA;combined in large numbers can harass and&#xA;kill a mighty elephant, Let us proceed. It&#xA;will not do any longer to leave Drona&#xA;unsupported.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DRONA made many attempts to take&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;prisoner,&#xA;but&#xA;failed.&#xA;Duryodhana led a large elephant division&#xA;against Bhima. Bhima defended himself&#xA;from his chariot with well-aimed arrows.&#xA;He sent crescent-headed shafts and tore&#xA;down Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s flag and cut down his&#xA;bow even as he held it in his hand. Seeing&#xA;the king harassed in this manner, the&#xA;Mlechchha king Anga marched against&#xA;Bhimasena seated on a huge elephant.&#xA;But Bhima sent shafts that laid the&#xA;elephant low and killed the Mlechchha&#xA;king, which resulted in scattering that&#xA;section of the Kaurava forces in fear and&#xA;confusion.&#xA;When&#xA;the&#xA;elephants&#xA;stampeded, the horses also took fright and&#xA;thousands of footmen were trampled&#xA;under the feet of the elephants and the&#xA;horses, flying in wild panic.&#xA;Seeing this great confusion and the&#xA;scattering of the Kaurava forces in all&#xA;directions, the king of Pragjyotisha, the&#xA;brave Bhagadatta grew indignant.&#xA;He got up on his renowned elephant&#xA;Supratika and charged against Bhimasena.&#xA;The gigantic beast rushed forward with&#xA;widespread ears and twirling trunk,&#xA;crashed into Bhimasena&amp;rsquo;s chariot. And in&#xA;an instant, horses and vehicle were an&#xA;unrecognizable mass. But Bhima escaped&#xA;by jumping off the car in the nick of time.&#xA;He knew all about elephants. He got&#xA;below the great and fierce elephant and&#xA;showered blows on its vital points. The&#xA;great beast got mad and whirled round&#xA;like a potter&amp;rsquo;s wheel, trying to throw off&#xA;Bhimasena, who was sticking to its legs&#xA;and attcking it from below.&#xA;It bent down and caught Bhima by its&#xA;trunk and was about to crush him under its&#xA;knees, when Vrikodara somehow released&#xA;himself from its hold and again got below,&#xA;in between its limbs and sticking to the&#xA;elephant&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;under-regions,&#xA;caused&#xA;exceeding pain to the beast.&#xA;Bhima was thus gaining time in the hope&#xA;that some elephant on the Pandava side&#xA;would be led to attack Bhagadatta&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;elephant and enable him to get away.&#xA;But, when Bhima disappeared from view,&#xA;being hidden in between the beast&amp;rsquo;s legs,&#xA;the soldiers thought Bhima was slain.&#xA;They exclaimed: &amp;ldquo;Bhima is dead!&#xA;Bhagadatta&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;elephant&#xA;has&#xA;crushed&#xA;Bhimasena!&amp;rdquo; and the cry was repeated all&#xA;over Kurukshetra.&#xA;Yudhishthira heard the cry and, thinking&#xA;Bhima was slain, urged the forces to&#xA;destroy Bhagadatta. The king of Dasarna&#xA;charged against Bhagadatta. Dasarna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;elephant was also a fierce beast and there&#xA;was great battle between Supratika and&#xA;Dasarna&amp;rsquo;s elephant.&#xA;But Supratika&amp;rsquo;s tusk pierced Dasarna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;beast in the side and it crashed down dead.&#xA;At that moment, Bhima emerged from&#xA;below Supratika and ran out safe. And the&#xA;Pandava army cheered when they saw&#xA;Bhima alive.&#xA;Bhagadatta was now attacked on all sides,&#xA;but he did not lose heart. Resplendent on&#xA;his elephant, he shone like a forest fire on&#xA;a hill. Ignoring the enemies around him,&#xA;he drove his beast on Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s chariot.The elephant seized the chariot with its&#xA;great trunk and lifting it high dashed it&#xA;upside down. Satyaki jumped out of the&#xA;chariot in time to save himself.&#xA;His charioteer displayed great agility and&#xA;skill and saved the vehicle as well as the&#xA;horses, and righting the chariot, drove it to&#xA;where Satyaki stood.&#xA;Bhagadatta&amp;rsquo;s elephant wrought great&#xA;havoc in the Pandava army, hurling&#xA;warriors about and killing them in great&#xA;number, striking terror wherever it went.&#xA;Bhagadatta stood on its back, like Indra&#xA;on Airavata when he fought the asuras.&#xA;With ears spread out rigid in anger and&#xA;trunk extended in front, the great beast&#xA;trampled upon numerous horses, chariots&#xA;and soldiers and wrought destruction all&#xA;over the Pandava army. The shafts hurled&#xA;at it seemed only to incense it more.&#xA;Like a herdsman in the forest driving the&#xA;cattle where he would, Bhagadatta drove&#xA;the soldiers of the Pandava army before&#xA;him. Bhimasena, equipping himself once&#xA;again with a chariot, renewed his attack&#xA;on Bhagadatta.&#xA;The elephant stretched out its trunk and&#xA;blew out a violent spray of mucus that&#xA;scared the horses of Bhima&amp;rsquo;s chariot and&#xA;they bolted in wild flight and the&#xA;charioteer could not check them.&#xA;A great cloud of dust rose from the field&#xA;where this great elephant battle raged.&#xA;Arjuna saw this from where he was&#xA;fighting the samsaptakas and he also&#xA;heard the tumult created by Bhagadatta&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;elephant.&#xA;He feared things had gone wrong and said&#xA;to Krishna: &amp;ldquo;Madhusudana, this is the cry&#xA;of Supratika, Bhagadatta&amp;rsquo;s elephant. This&#xA;king of Pragjyotisha is terrible with his&#xA;elephant, and has no equal in that kind of&#xA;warfare. He is sure to defeat and confound&#xA;our men. We must proceed at once and&#xA;save the situation. We have punished&#xA;these samsaptakas enough. Drive to where&#xA;Drona is engaging Yudhishthira.&amp;rdquo; Krishna&#xA;drove the chariot accordingly towards the&#xA;main battlefront.&#xA;Susarma and his brothers came up behind&#xA;the chariot and shouted &amp;ldquo;Stop, stop.&amp;rdquo; At&#xA;the same time, they discharged shafts at&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s chariot.&#xA;Arjuna was of two minds.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Here is Susarma challenging me to battle&#xA;and I hated declining this kind of&#xA;invitation, but there, to the north of us, our&#xA;formation seems broken and our men are&#xA;in need of immediate relief.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;While Arjuna was pondering thus, a&#xA;javelin came hurtling at Arjuna and&#xA;another towards Janardana. Wild with&#xA;anger, Arjuna sent three well-aimed&#xA;shafts, which compelled Susarma to turn&#xA;back.&#xA;They lost no more time but drove quickly&#xA;to where Bhagadatta was doing havoc. As&#xA;soon as Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s car was seen, the&#xA;Pandava forces rallied and soon Arjuna&#xA;reached the lines where Bhagadatta was.&#xA;Bhagadatta attacked Arjuna on Supratika&#xA;like the Destroyer incarnate. But&#xA;Vasudeva&amp;rsquo;s skill avoided the shock, each&#xA;time the beast charged.&#xA;Bhagadatta showered arrows on Arjuna&#xA;and Krishna. But Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s arrows broke&#xA;the elephant&amp;rsquo;s armor and began to hurt the&#xA;beast. Bhagadatta saw that his elephant&#xA;could no longer stand the attack and he&#xA;hurled a javelin at Krishna.&#xA;Arjuna met it with a shaft from his bow&#xA;and broke it into two. Bhagadatta then&#xA;discharged another javelin that struck&#xA;Dhananjaya&amp;rsquo;s helmet.&#xA;Readjusting his helmet, Arjuna bent his&#xA;bow exclaiming: &amp;ldquo;Bhagadatta, take your&#xA;last look at the world and prepare for&#xA;death!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhagadatta was a veteran of very&#xA;advanced age. His grey hair and the&#xA;wrinkles on his noble old face gave him&#xA;the intrepid appearance of a lion. Indeed,so old was he that the skin hung loose&#xA;down over his eyes and he had tied its&#xA;folds over his forehead with a silk&#xA;kerchief so that they might not interfere&#xA;with his sight.&#xA;Bhagadatta was not more renowned for&#xA;valor than for purity of character and&#xA;conduct and was one of the most&#xA;illustrious among the brave men of his&#xA;time. Men gave him the title &amp;lsquo;Friend of&#xA;Indra&amp;rsquo; in recognition of his greatness.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Look around for the last time,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Arjuna to this great man and hurled at him&#xA;shafts that broke his bow, shattered his&#xA;quiver and pierced the joints of his armor.&#xA;In those days, all warriors wore heavy&#xA;armor and the secret of hitting weak&#xA;points such as joints and moving parts was&#xA;specially studied by kshatriyas and was an&#xA;important part of military training.&#xA;When deprived of all his weapons,&#xA;Bhagadatta hurled his elephant goad at&#xA;Arjuna. It was sent with deadly aim and&#xA;charged with the Vaishnava mantra.&#xA;It would have killed Arjuna, but Krishna&#xA;came in between and presented himself as&#xA;a target for the missile. It settled on his&#xA;chest as a shining necklace.&#xA;Charged with the mantra of Vishnu, it&#xA;could not hurt Vishnu but just became the&#xA;Lord&amp;rsquo;s jewelled garland round his neck.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Janardana, how is it you have offered&#xA;yourself as a target for the enemy&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;missile? You said you would be charioteer&#xA;and leave all the fighting to me. How&#xA;could you do this?&amp;rdquo; protested Arjuna.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Beloved Arjuna, you do not understand.&#xA;This shaft would have killed you if it had&#xA;hit you. But it is really my own thing and&#xA;came back to its lawful owner,&amp;rdquo; Krishna&#xA;said and laughed. Then, Partha sent an&#xA;arrow that entered the head of&#xA;Bhagadatta&amp;rsquo;s elephant as a serpent enters&#xA;into the anthill.&#xA;Bhagadatta tried to urge his great beast&#xA;forward, but it stood stark rigid. And his&#xA;loud command went in vain even as the&#xA;words of man, who has lost his wealth, are&#xA;disregarded by his wife.&#xA;Like a great hill the elephant stood rigid&#xA;for a moment and then it suddenly sank&#xA;down driving its tusks into the earth and&#xA;yielded up the ghost with an agonised&#xA;squeal.&#xA;Arjuna was somewhat grieved at the death&#xA;of the noble animal and for his not having&#xA;been able to slay Bhagadatta, without&#xA;killing the beast.&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s shafts tore the silken napkin that&#xA;bound up the folds of the aged king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;forehead and he was blinded at once by&#xA;his own hanging wrinkles.&#xA;Soon, a sharp crescent-headed shaft came&#xA;and pierced his chest. And Bhagadatta fell&#xA;like a great tree in a storm, his golden&#xA;necklace shining like flowers on the&#xA;uprooted tree. The Kaurava forces fell into&#xA;utter confusion.&#xA;Sakuni&amp;rsquo;s brothers Vrisha and Achala tried&#xA;their best to oppose Arjuna and attacked&#xA;him in front and rear. But their chariots&#xA;were soon dashed to pieces and they were&#xA;themselves stricken dead on the field like&#xA;two lion cubs. They both looked much&#xA;alike and equally noble in appearance.&#xA;The poet says that the bodies of these two&#xA;valiant heroes who did not flee when the&#xA;rest fled, shed a strange lustre all around.&#xA;Sakuni was full of anger when he saw his&#xA;brave and incomparable brothers lying&#xA;dead on the field.&#xA;He attacked Arjuna fiercely and used all&#xA;the weapons of illusion, in which he was&#xA;skilled. But Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s strokes broke all the&#xA;charms and rendered them useless. And&#xA;Sakuni had to leave the field, as fast as his&#xA;horses could bear him.&#xA;The Pandava forces then attacked Drona&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;army and wrought great havoc till the&#xA;sunset, and the twelfth day&amp;rsquo;s fight ended.&#xA;Drona gave orders to cease fighting and&#xA;the Kaurava forces, which had lostheavily, retired in sullen dejection to their&#xA;camp.&#xA;The Pandava army, on the other band, was&#xA;in high spirits and its warriors gathered&#xA;round campfires in cheerful talk and&#xA;praise of Arjuna and the other heroes, who&#xA;had led them to victory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EARLY next morning, Duryodhana went&#xA;to Dronacharya in a state of bitterness and&#xA;anger. After the customary salutation, he&#xA;addressed him thus in the presence of a&#xA;large number of generals:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Esteemed brahmana, Yudhishthira was&#xA;quite within your reach yesterday and, if&#xA;you had really wished to take him no one&#xA;could have prevented you. Yet, you did&#xA;not take him, and to me the events of&#xA;yesterday are inexplicable. I cannot&#xA;understand what makes it hard for you to&#xA;carry out your promise to me. Verily great&#xA;men are not understandable.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dronacharya was exceedingly hurt by this&#xA;insulting insinuation.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Duryodhana,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;I am putting forth&#xA;on your be half all the strength and skill I&#xA;possess. You entertain thoughts unworthy&#xA;of a king. As long as Arjuna is present,&#xA;supporting Yudhishthira, it is not possible&#xA;for us to seize him. I have told you that&#xA;already. It is only if we manage some how&#xA;to get Arjuna out of the battlefield that we&#xA;can hope to carry out this plan as you&#xA;desire. And I am devising ways to attain&#xA;this objective.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus did Drona nobly conquer his just&#xA;anger and seek to comfort Duryodhana in&#xA;his distress.&#xA;On the thirteenth day, the samsaptakas&#xA;again challenged Arjuna to battle and he&#xA;accordingly went to attack them, where&#xA;they were arrayed to the south of the main&#xA;battlefront. The battle that was fought&#xA;between the samsaptakas and Arjuna was&#xA;the fiercest that ever had been seen or&#xA;heard of till that day.&#xA;When Dhananjaya left the main front for&#xA;meeting&#xA;the&#xA;samsaptakas,&#xA;Drona&#xA;rearranged his army in lotus formation&#xA;and attacked Yudhishthira fiercely.&#xA;Bhima,&#xA;Satyaki,&#xA;Chekitana,&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna, Kuntibhoja, Drupada,&#xA;Ghatotkacha, Yudhamanyu, Sikhandin,&#xA;Uttamaujas,&#xA;Virata,&#xA;the&#xA;Kekayas,&#xA;Srinjayas and many others opposed him.&#xA;But their resistance seemed paralysed by&#xA;the violence of Drona&amp;rsquo;s offensive.&#xA;Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna and Subhadra,&#xA;was still adolescent, but had already won&#xA;recognition as a mighty man-at arms even&#xA;as the equal of his father and uncle in&#xA;battle. Yudhishthira called Abhimanyu&#xA;and said to him:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dear son, Dronacharya is attacking our&#xA;army greatly. Arjuna is absent and, if we&#xA;should be defeated in his absence, he will&#xA;be grieved beyond measure. No one&#xA;among us has been able to break Drona&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;array. You know you can do it and no one&#xA;else. I ask you to take up this task.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I can do it,&amp;rdquo; replied Abhimanyu. &amp;ldquo;I have&#xA;been instructed by my father how to&#xA;penetrate this formation and can certainly&#xA;do so. But if after forcing my way, it&#xA;should unfortunately become necessary&#xA;for me to come out, I shall be at a loss&#xA;what to do, being as yet uninstructed in&#xA;the art of extrication.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Valiant boy, break this impregnable&#xA;formation and open a passage for us. We&#xA;shall all break in your wake. We shall be&#xA;with you to face any danger and no&#xA;question can arise of your having to come&#xA;out.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhimasena&#xA;supported&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;proposal: &amp;ldquo;I shall be immediately behind&#xA;you and enter when you succeed in&#xA;breaking the enemy&amp;rsquo;s formation. So also&#xA;will&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna,&#xA;Satyaki,&#xA;the&#xA;Panchalas, the Kekayas and the forces of&#xA;Matsyadesa. Only break the formation asyou alone can do. We shall do the rest and&#xA;smash the Kaurava army.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Abhimanyu thought of his father and&#xA;Krishna. Feeling encouraged by what had&#xA;been&#xA;said&#xA;by&#xA;Bhimasena&#xA;and&#xA;Yudhishthira, and impelled by his own&#xA;gallant nature, undertook the adventure.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I shall please my great father and uncle,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he said with enthusiasm. &amp;ldquo;Let my valor be&#xA;staked on this.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;May&#xA;your&#xA;prowess&#xA;grow,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said&#xA;Yudhishthira and blessed the youth.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sumitra, see Drona&amp;rsquo;s flag flying there!&#xA;Drive straight and fast to that point,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Abhimanyu to his charioteer.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Faster, faster!&amp;rdquo; urged Abhimanyu as they&#xA;sped along.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;May the gods protect you!&amp;rdquo; said the&#xA;charioteer. &amp;ldquo;Yudhishthira has placed a&#xA;very great burden on your young&#xA;shoulders. Think well before you pierce&#xA;Drona&amp;rsquo;s array and enter. The acharya is&#xA;unrivalled in skill and experience, while&#xA;you, though his equal in valor, have not&#xA;his long years to back it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Abhimanyu smiled and replied: &amp;ldquo;Friend, I&#xA;am Krishna&amp;rsquo;s nephew and son of Arjuna,&#xA;am I not? Which other has that advantage?&#xA;Fear dares not approach me! These&#xA;enemies here have not a sixteenth part of&#xA;my strength. Drive fast towards Drona&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;division. Do not hesitate.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The charioteer obeyed.&#xA;As the golden chariot to which were&#xA;yoked beautiful young horses approached,&#xA;the soldiers in the Kaurava army shouted:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Abhimanyu is corning! He has come!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Pandavas followed Abhimanyu close&#xA;behind him.&#xA;The Kaurava warriors were perturbed as&#xA;they saw Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s chariot approach&#xA;them with great speed.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Here is one greater in valor than Arjuna,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;they thought and began to lose heart.&#xA;Like a young lion on a herd of elephants,&#xA;Abhimanyu rushed on. There was a ripple&#xA;in the Kaurava ranks which bent under his&#xA;headlong onslaught.&#xA;The bend soon became a break and under&#xA;Drona&amp;rsquo;s very eyes, the formation was&#xA;breached and Abhimanyu entered. But the&#xA;breach closed under the inspiration of&#xA;Jayadratha, king of the Sindhus, before&#xA;the other Pandava warriors could force&#xA;their way in according to plan and&#xA;Abhimanyu was alone!&#xA;Kaurava warriors opposed him, but they&#xA;fell like moths in the fire, one after&#xA;another. Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s shafts searched the&#xA;weak points in the armor of his enemies.&#xA;And the bodies of soldiers lay strewn on&#xA;the field like Kusa grass on the sacrificial&#xA;platform.&#xA;Bows, arrows, swords, shields, javelins,&#xA;pieces of harness, chaiot canopies, axes,&#xA;maces, spears, whips, conchs, along with&#xA;severed heads and limbs of slain warriors,&#xA;covered the field.&#xA;Seeing the destruction wrought by&#xA;Abhimanyu, Duryodhana was wroth and&#xA;rushed in person to oppose the youthful&#xA;warrior. Drona, having leant that the king&#xA;himself was engaged in battle with&#xA;Abhimanyu, became anxious and sent&#xA;veterans to protect Duryodhana.&#xA;With great difficulty, they managed to&#xA;rescue the king from the boy-hero who&#xA;greatly disappointed at the escape of&#xA;Duryodhana, vented his anger on the&#xA;warriors that had come to rescue him and&#xA;put them to headlong flight.&#xA;Then, throwing away all sense of shame&#xA;and chivalry, a large number of veteran&#xA;warriors&#xA;made&#xA;a&#xA;combined&#xA;and&#xA;simultaneous attack on the hero, who&#xA;found himself alone, surrounded by&#xA;enemies on all sides. But, even as on all&#xA;sides a rock receives the rising tide of the&#xA;sea, Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s son withstood this united&#xA;ouslaught.&#xA;Drona, Aswatthama, Kripa, Karna,&#xA;Sakuni, Salya and many other greatwarriors in their chariots, equipped with&#xA;all arms, surged in attack on the young&#xA;hero, only to be dashed back, baffled and&#xA;broken.&#xA;Asmaka rode his chariot at great speed&#xA;against&#xA;Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s.&#xA;But&#xA;smiling,&#xA;Abhimanyu sent his shafts and disposed&#xA;of him in no time. Karna&amp;rsquo;s armor was&#xA;pierced.&#xA;Salya was badly wounded and sat, unable&#xA;to move, in his chariot. Salya&amp;rsquo;s brother&#xA;came up in great wrath to avenge his&#xA;brother&amp;rsquo;s disgrace but he fell and his&#xA;chariot was broken to pieces.&#xA;Thus&#xA;did&#xA;Abhimanyu,&#xA;alone&#xA;and&#xA;unsupported, oppose a host of veteran&#xA;warriors and show the skill in the use of&#xA;arms which he had learnt from his&#xA;illustrious father and from Vasudeva, his&#xA;uncle. Seeing this, the poet says,&#xA;Dronacharya&amp;rsquo;s eyes were filled with tears&#xA;of affectionate admiration.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Was there ever a fighter to equal this boy&#xA;Abhimanyu?&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Drona to Kripa,&#xA;in the hearing of Duryodhana who could&#xA;not contain his anger.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The acharya&amp;rsquo;s partiality for Arjuna&#xA;prevents him from killing Abhimanyu,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana said, &amp;ldquo;and he sings his praises&#xA;instead of fighting him. Indeed, if the&#xA;acharya were minded to dispose of&#xA;Abhimanyu, would it take him long to do&#xA;it!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Often did Duryodhana suspect and&#xA;complain in this manner against Bhishma&#xA;and Drona. Having undertaken a war of&#xA;adharma, he was often led to speak in this&#xA;manner and hurt the feelings of the&#xA;acharyas who stood loyally by him, even&#xA;when they saw the wickedness of his&#xA;ways.&#xA;Duhsasana&#xA;roared&#xA;in&#xA;anger&#xA;and&#xA;exclaiming: &amp;ldquo;This obstinate lad will perish&#xA;now!&amp;rdquo; led his chariot forward to attack&#xA;Abhimanyu. The chariots of Abhimanyu&#xA;and&#xA;Duhsasana&#xA;made&#xA;wonderful&#xA;movement against each other and the&#xA;battle raged long.&#xA;Duhsasana was struck senseless in his car,&#xA;and his charioteer just managed to drive&#xA;away from the field saving Duhsasana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;life. Karna attacked Abhimanyu with his&#xA;shafts and harassed him greatly.&#xA;But one of Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s arrows felled&#xA;Karna&amp;rsquo;s bow and the young warrior&#xA;followed up this advantage so vigorously&#xA;that he put Karna and his supporters to&#xA;flight. The Kaurava forces, when they saw&#xA;this, were completely demoralised.&#xA;The army was in confusion and men fled&#xA;in all directions, not caring for Drona&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;shouts of remonstrance. And Abhimanyu&#xA;destroyed those that stood, as fire destroys&#xA;a dry jungle in summer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE Pandavas, proceeding according to&#xA;plan, had closely followed Abhimanyu&#xA;when he broke into the Kaurava&#xA;formation. But Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s son-in-law&#xA;Jayadratha, the gallant king of the&#xA;Sindhus, swooped down upon the&#xA;Pandavas with all his forces and enabled&#xA;the breach in the formation to be&#xA;effectively and solidly closed up, so that&#xA;the Pandavas found it impossible to force&#xA;their way in.&#xA;Yudhishthira hurled a javelin and cut&#xA;Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s bow. But in an instant, the&#xA;Saindhava took up another bow and sent&#xA;unerring shafts at Dharmaputra.&#xA;Bhimasena&amp;rsquo;s arrows made deadly work,&#xA;crashing down the canopy and flagstaff of&#xA;Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s car. But the Saindhava, was&#xA;alert and rearmed himself, each time his&#xA;equipment was broken. He killed Bhima&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot horses, and the latter had to go into&#xA;Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s car.&#xA;In this manner, Jayadratha, with stubborn&#xA;valor, prevented the Pandavas from&#xA;entering in Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s wake. The young&#xA;hero was thus isolated and surrounded by&#xA;the Kaurava forces.The son of Subhadra was however&#xA;undaunted. He attacked all the warriors&#xA;around him and slew them in great&#xA;number. Like rivers losing themselves in&#xA;the ocean, the soldiers that went to attack&#xA;him, disappeared before his arrows. The&#xA;Kaurava army reeled under Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;onslaughts.&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s son Lakshmana, a gallant&#xA;young&#xA;warrior,&#xA;then&#xA;charged&#xA;on&#xA;Abhimanyu. When they saw this,&#xA;retreating soldiers came back and&#xA;supported Lakshmana, showering arrows&#xA;on Abhimanyu, like rain falling on a hill.&#xA;Still, Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s son was undaunted and, his&#xA;shaft came swift and shining, like a&#xA;serpent fresh-sloughed, and pierced&#xA;Lakshmana. The handsome youth, with&#xA;beautiful nose and eyebrows and hair, lay&#xA;dead on the field and the Kaurava soldiers&#xA;were filled with grief.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;To hell with the wicked Abhimanyu,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;shouted Duryodhana, and the six great&#xA;warriors,&#xA;Dorna,&#xA;Kripa,&#xA;Karna,&#xA;Aswatthama, Brihatbala and Kritavarma&#xA;closed upon Abhimanyu.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;It is impossible to pierce this youth&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;armor,&amp;rdquo; said Drona to Karna. &amp;ldquo;Aim at the&#xA;reins of his horses and cut them off.&#xA;Disable him thus and attack him from&#xA;behind.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The son of Surya did accordingly.&#xA;Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s bow was broken by a shaft&#xA;discharged from behind. His horses and&#xA;charioteer were killed. Thus disabled, the&#xA;young warrior stood on the field, with&#xA;sword and shield, facing his enemies.&#xA;As he stood dauntless like kshatriya&#xA;dharma incarnate, he filled the warriors&#xA;around with amazement. Whirling his&#xA;sword, he held his own against the&#xA;numerous warriors who had surrounded&#xA;him, with a skill that confounded them.&#xA;It seemed to them as if his feet did not rest&#xA;on earth and he was on wings, in the air.&#xA;Drona sent a shaft that broke Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;sword. Karna&amp;rsquo;s sharp arrows tore his&#xA;shield into bits.&#xA;Then Abhimanyu bent down and taking&#xA;up one of his chariot wheels and whirling&#xA;it like a discus, stood up facing all the&#xA;enemies that surrounded him.&#xA;The dust from the chariot wheel covered&#xA;him and the poet says it enhanced the&#xA;natural beauty of the young hero. He&#xA;fought fiercely like a second Vishnu with&#xA;the discus.&#xA;But soon, the combined onslaught of the&#xA;warriors&#xA;that&#xA;surrounded&#xA;him&#xA;overpowered him. The chariot wheel was&#xA;shattered to pieces. The son of Duhsasana&#xA;came up then and closed with him in&#xA;mortal combat.&#xA;Both went down together but Duhsasana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;son rose again and, while Abhimanyu was&#xA;struggling to his feet, struck him with his&#xA;mace and killed him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Subhadra&amp;rsquo;s son who, like an elephant in a&#xA;lily pond, single-handed worked havoc in&#xA;the Kaurava army, was thus overpowered&#xA;by numbers and killed cruelly,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Sanjaya to Dhritarashtra.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;And, having killed him, your people&#xA;danced around his dead body like savage&#xA;hunters exulting over their prey. All good&#xA;men in the army were grieved and tears&#xA;rolled from their eyes. Even the birds of&#xA;prey, that circled overhead making noises&#xA;seemed to cry &amp;lsquo;Not thus!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Not thus!&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot;&#xA;While there was blowing of conchs and&#xA;cries of victory all over the Kaurava army,&#xA;Yuyutsu, the son of Dhritarashtra, did not&#xA;approve of all this. &amp;ldquo;This is ignoble,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;angrily cried.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Soldiers, you have forgotten your code.&#xA;Verily, you should be ashamed but,&#xA;instead, you shout brazen cries of victory.&#xA;Having committed a most wicked deed,&#xA;you revel in foolish joy, blind to the&#xA;danger that is imminent.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So saying, Yuyutsu threw his weapon&#xA;away in disgust and left the battlefield.This young son of Dhritarashtra feared&#xA;sin. His words were not sweet in the&#xA;Kaurava ears, but he was a good man and&#xA;spoke out his mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YUDHISHTHIRA&#xA;was&#xA;plunged&#xA;in&#xA;sorrow. &amp;ldquo;He has gone to the sleep that&#xA;knows no waking, he who in battle&#xA;overcame&#xA;Drona,&#xA;Aswatthama&#xA;and&#xA;Duryodhana and who was like a&#xA;destroying fire to enemy forces. O warrior&#xA;that made Duhsasana flee in fear, are you&#xA;dead? What then is there for me to fight&#xA;for or win? Why do we want kingdom&#xA;now? What words of comfort can I offer&#xA;to Arjuna? And what shall I say to&#xA;Subhadra, quivering like a cow bereaved&#xA;of her calf? How can I utter to them vain&#xA;words of solace that serve no purpose?&#xA;Truly,&#xA;ambition&#xA;destroys&#xA;the&#xA;understanding of men. Like the fool who,&#xA;looking for honey, falls into a precipitous&#xA;pit below and is destroyed, in my desire&#xA;for victory I pushed to the battlefront this&#xA;boy, whose life was all before him in love&#xA;and joy. There is no fool like me in the&#xA;world. I have killed Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s beloved son,&#xA;instead of protecting him during the&#xA;absence of his father.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus was Yudhishthira lamenting in&#xA;histent. Around him were sitting warriors,&#xA;silent in sorrowful thought of the valor of&#xA;the youthful hero and his cruel death. It&#xA;was always the custom with Vyasa to&#xA;come and comfort the Pandavas,&#xA;whenever they were in great sorrow.&#xA;He was their great teacher as well as&#xA;grandsire. So he appeared now before&#xA;Yudhishthira. The sage was received with&#xA;all honor and Yudhishthira, having made&#xA;him sit, said: &amp;ldquo;I have tried very hard to&#xA;find peace of mind, but I am unable to&#xA;find it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are wise and a knower,&amp;rdquo; said Vyasa,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;and it is not meet that you should allow&#xA;yourself to be lost in grief in this manner.&#xA;Knowing the nature of death, it is not right&#xA;that you should grieve like the unlearned.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vyasa proceeded to console the bereaved&#xA;Dharmaputra: &amp;ldquo;When Brahma created&#xA;living beings, he was filled with anxiety.&#xA;These lives will multiply and soon their&#xA;number will be beyond the capacity of the&#xA;earth to bear. There seems to be no way of&#xA;coping with this. This thought of Brahma&#xA;grew into a flame which became bigger&#xA;and bigger until it threatened to destroy all&#xA;creation at once. Then Rudra came and&#xA;pleaded for allaying this destructive fire.&#xA;Brahma controlled the great fire and&#xA;subdued it into the law that is known to&#xA;mortals as Death. This law of the creator&#xA;takes many forms, such as war or sickness&#xA;or accident and keeps the balance between&#xA;birth and death. Death is thus an&#xA;inescapable law of existence, ordained for&#xA;the good of the world. It is not true&#xA;wisdom to be impatient with Death or to&#xA;grieve immoderately for those who die.&#xA;There is no reason to pity those who pass&#xA;away. We may have reason indeed to&#xA;grieve for those who remain.&amp;rdquo; After&#xA;saying these words of solace, Krishna&#xA;Dwaipayana retired.&#xA;Dhananjaya and Krishna were proceeding&#xA;towards their camp after defeating and&#xA;slaying the samsaptakas.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Govinda, I do not know why,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Arjuna, &amp;ldquo;but my mind is not at ease. My&#xA;mouth feels parched and my heart is&#xA;troubled with a great foreboding of loss. I&#xA;wonder if any calamity has happened to&#xA;Yudhishthira.&#xA;Something&#xA;makes&#xA;me&#xA;afraid, Krishna.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do&#xA;not&#xA;be&#xA;concerned&#xA;about&#xA;Yudhishthira,&amp;rdquo; replied Krishna.&amp;ldquo;He and&#xA;your other brothers are safe.&amp;rdquo; On the way,&#xA;they halted and did the evening prayers.&#xA;Remounting the chariot, they proceeded to&#xA;the camp. As they approached the camp,&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;premonitions&#xA;of&#xA;calamity&#xA;increased.&amp;ldquo;Janardana, we do not hear the usual&#xA;auspicious music in the camp. The&#xA;soldiers, seeing me from a distance, hang&#xA;down their heads and avoid my sight. This&#xA;is strange behavior on their part. O&#xA;Madhava, I fear greatly. Do you think my&#xA;brothers are safe? I am confused. How is&#xA;it Abhimanyu does not run out to meet us&#xA;today as usual, accompanied by his&#xA;brothers?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They entered the camp.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why are you all wearing sad faces? I do&#xA;not see Abhimanyu here. How is it I see&#xA;no glad faces? I understood that Drona&#xA;arrayed his army in the lotus formation.&#xA;No one among you could pierce it as far&#xA;as I know. Did Abhimanyu force his way&#xA;in? If so, he is dead, for I did not teach&#xA;him how to make his way out of that&#xA;formation. Has he been slain indeed?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When their mournful silence, and&#xA;downcast eyes, that dared not meet his,&#xA;had confirmed his worst fears, the&#xA;bereaved father burst into heart-broken&#xA;lamentation.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Alas, has my dear boy indeed become&#xA;Yama&amp;rsquo;s guest? Yudhishthira, Bhimasena,&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna and great Satyaki have&#xA;all of you allowed the son of Subhadra to&#xA;be slain by the enemy? Alas! What&#xA;comfort shall I give to Subhadra? What&#xA;shall. I say to Draupadi? And what solace&#xA;can be given to Uttara and who shall give&#xA;it?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vasudeva spoke to his stricken friend.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Beloved Arjuna,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;do not give&#xA;way thus to grief. Born as kshatriyas we&#xA;have to live and die by weapons. Death is&#xA;ever the companion of those who have&#xA;taken up the profession of arms and go&#xA;into battle, determined not to retreat.&#xA;Warriors must be ever ready to die young.&#xA;Abhimanyu, boy as he was, has attained&#xA;the happy regions above which grey&#xA;haired veterans yearn to reach in battle.&#xA;Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s end is indeed the prescribed&#xA;and much desired goal of all kshatriyas. If&#xA;you give way to grief in this inordinate&#xA;way, your brothers and other kings will&#xA;lose heart. Stop grieving and infuse&#xA;courage and fortitude into the hearts of the&#xA;others,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhananjaya desired to be told the full&#xA;story of his brave son&amp;rsquo;s end and&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;related&#xA;it:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I&#xA;incited&#xA;Abhimanyu&#xA;to enter the enemy&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;formation. For I knew that he alone could&#xA;do it among all of us. &amp;lsquo;Make your way into&#xA;the lotus array and we shall follow&#xA;immediately behind you. This great deed&#xA;of yours will please the hearts of your&#xA;father and your uncle,&amp;rsquo; I said. The youthful&#xA;hero did accordingly and broke the great&#xA;formation and made his way in. We went&#xA;behind him according to plan. But, just&#xA;then, the wicked Jayadratha came and&#xA;effectively stopped us. He caused the&#xA;breach in the formation to be closed up at&#xA;once and we found ourselves unable to&#xA;follow Abhimanyu. The Sindhu kept us&#xA;out, and then, Oh, shame on kshatriyas&#xA;who could do this! A crowd of&#xA;redoubtable warriors hemmed him in, thus&#xA;isolated, and slew him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When he heard the full story, Arjuna was&#xA;again over whelmed by grief and he fell&#xA;on the ground in a swoon.&#xA;When he recovered, he took an oath:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Before sunset tomorrow, I shall slay this&#xA;Jayadratha who caused my son&amp;rsquo;s death. If&#xA;Drona and Kripa come between him and&#xA;me these acharyas also shall be&#xA;overwhelmed and slain!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying this, he twanged the Gandiva&#xA;string, and Krishna blew the Panchajanya.&#xA;And Bhima said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This twang of Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s bow and this&#xA;blare of Krishna&amp;rsquo;s conch shall be, unto the&#xA;sons of Dhritarashtra, the summons of&#xA;Death!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NEWS of Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s oath reached the&#xA;enemy. The spies informed Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;friends that Arjuna, having learnt that&#xA;Jayadratha was the cause of Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;death, had vowed to kill the Sindhu king&#xA;before sunset next day.&#xA;Vriddhakshatra, the illustrious king of the&#xA;Sindhus, was blessed with a son, who was&#xA;named Jayadratha. At the time of the birth&#xA;of the prince, a voice was heard to say:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This prince will attain great glory and he&#xA;will attain the happy regions above, slain&#xA;in battle. One who, among the warriors of&#xA;all ages, ranks among the most illustrious&#xA;will, in the field of battle, sever his head&#xA;from the body.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;All living beings must die but hardly any,&#xA;however wise or brave, welcome it.&#xA;Vriddhakshatra was grieved to hear the&#xA;voice declare his son&amp;rsquo;s end.&#xA;In his disturbed state of mind, he uttered a&#xA;curse: &amp;ldquo;He, who shall cause my son&amp;rsquo;s head&#xA;to roll down on the ground, shall have his&#xA;head burst at that very moment into&#xA;fragments.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Jayadratha grew up and, when he reached&#xA;manhood, Vriddhakshatra handed over the&#xA;care of the State to the prince. He retired&#xA;to the forest, where he spent the evening&#xA;of his days in austerities in an ashrama&#xA;near the plain, which afterwards became&#xA;the Kurukshetra field of battle.&#xA;When Jayadratha came to know about&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s vow, he remembered the&#xA;prediction about his death and feared his&#xA;end was near.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I do not want to be in this battle any&#xA;longer. Let me go back to my country,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;said to Duryodhana.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do not fear, Saindhava,&amp;rdquo; replied&#xA;Duryodhana. &amp;ldquo;Here are all these veterans&#xA;and warriors who will stand between you&#xA;and danger. Karna, Chitrasena, Vivimsati,&#xA;Bhurisravas,&#xA;Salya,&#xA;Vrishasena,&#xA;Purumitra,&#xA;Jaya,&#xA;Bhoja,&#xA;Kamboja,&#xA;Sudakshina,&#xA;Satyavrata,&#xA;Vikarna,&#xA;Durmukha, Duhsasana, Subahu, Kalinga,&#xA;the Avanti princes, Drona, Drona&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;illustrious son and Sakuni all these&#xA;warriors and I myself are here and you&#xA;cannot be in danger. The whole of my&#xA;army will have but one task today, to&#xA;defend you against Arjuna. You should&#xA;not leave us now.&amp;rdquo; Jayadratha agreed to&#xA;remain. He went to Drona and said to him:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Master, you taught me and Arjuna and&#xA;you know us both well. What is your&#xA;appraisal of us two?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Son, I discharged my duties as teacher&#xA;and dealt with you both impartially. The&#xA;instruction was the same to you and to&#xA;Arjuna, but Arjuna excels because of his&#xA;superior discipline and his own practice.&#xA;But, you need not be discouraged by this.&#xA;You will be placed behind a strong force&#xA;that Arjuna cannot easily pierce. Fight&#xA;according to the tradition of your&#xA;ancestors. Death comes to us all, cowards&#xA;as well as brave men. And the warrior&#xA;dying in battle attains with ease the happy&#xA;regions which others only attain with&#xA;great difficulty. Discard fear and fight.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Drona, having spoken thus to Jayadratha,&#xA;proceeded to marshal the forces for the&#xA;next day. Twelve miles to the rear of the&#xA;main army Jayadratha and his detachment&#xA;were placed in a strongly guarded&#xA;position.&#xA;Bhurisravas, Karna, Aswatthama, Salya,&#xA;Vrishasena and Kripa were there with all&#xA;their forces. Between them and the&#xA;Pandava army, Dronacharya arrayed the&#xA;main&#xA;Kaurava&#xA;forces&#xA;in&#xA;circular&#xA;formation.&#xA;Durmarshana&amp;rsquo;s army was beaten. Like&#xA;clouds driven about by a gale, the&#xA;Kaurava forces were scattered and fled in&#xA;all directions. When Duhsasana saw this,&#xA;his anger rose.&#xA;Leading a huge force of elephants he&#xA;surrounded Arjuna. Duhsasana was a very&#xA;wicked man but he was brave also. Hefought Arjuna fiercely and the field was&#xA;strewn with the dead. Finally, he&#xA;withdrew defeated and went back to join&#xA;Drona&amp;rsquo;s forces.&#xA;Savyasachi&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;car&#xA;swiftly&#xA;proceeded&#xA;forward and passed Drona. &amp;ldquo;Illustrious&#xA;one, grieving for my son, I have come to&#xA;wreak vengeance on the Sindhu king. I&#xA;crave your blessings for the fulfilment of&#xA;my vow,&amp;rdquo; said Arjuna to the acharya.&#xA;The acharya smiled and said: &amp;ldquo;Arjuna, you&#xA;must first fight and defeat me before you&#xA;can reach Jayadratha.&amp;rdquo; Saying this Drona&#xA;discharged a shower of arrows on Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;car. Partha also replied with his arrows&#xA;but these the acharya parried with ease&#xA;and sent flaming shafts that hit Krishna&#xA;and Arjuna.&#xA;The Pandava then decided to cut Drona&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;bow and bent his Gandiva for that&#xA;purpose. Even as he was pulling his&#xA;bowstring Drona&amp;rsquo;s shaft came and cut the&#xA;string.&#xA;The acharya, still retaining the smile on&#xA;his face, rained a shower of arrows on&#xA;Arjuna and his horses and chariot. Arjuna&#xA;fought back, but the acharya showered his&#xA;arrows that covered Arjuna and his chariot&#xA;in darkness.&#xA;Krishna saw things were not going at all&#xA;well and said: &amp;ldquo;Partha, no more waste of&#xA;time. Let us proceed. It is no use fighting&#xA;this brahmana, who seems to know no&#xA;fatigue.&amp;rdquo; Saying this, Krishna drove&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s chariot to the left of the acharya&#xA;and proceeded forward.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Stop, surely you will not proceed without&#xA;defeating your enemy,&amp;rdquo; said Drona.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are my guru, not my enemy, O&#xA;acharya. I am in the position of a son to&#xA;you. There is no one in the wide world&#xA;that can defeat you,&amp;rdquo; said Arjuna and they&#xA;proceeded forward at a swift pace&#xA;bypassing Drona.&#xA;Then Arjuna pierced the Bhoja army.&#xA;Kritavarma and Sudakshina who opposed&#xA;his passage were defeated. Srutayudha&#xA;also tried to stop Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s progress. There&#xA;was a fierce battle in which Srutayudha&#xA;lost his horses and he hurled his mace at&#xA;Krishna.&#xA;His mother had obtained this mace as a&#xA;result of her offering but the condition&#xA;attached to the boon operated and it came&#xA;back and struck Srutayudha himself dead.&#xA;This is the story of the mace.&#xA;Parnasa went through penances that&#xA;pleased Varuna and obtained from that&#xA;god a boon that her son Srutayudha may&#xA;not be killed by any enemy.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I shall give your son a divine weapon.&#xA;Let him use it in all his battles. No enemy&#xA;will be able to defeat him or kill him. But&#xA;he should not use the weapon against one&#xA;who does not fight. If he does, the weapon&#xA;will recoil and kill him. Saying this, god&#xA;Varuna gave a mace. Srutayudha, when&#xA;fighting&#xA;Arjuna,&#xA;disregarding&#xA;the&#xA;injunction, hurled the mace at Krishna&#xA;who was not fighting but was only driving&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s chariot.&#xA;The missile hit Janardana&amp;rsquo;s chest and&#xA;immediately rebounded fiercely back to&#xA;Srutayudha. And like a demon recoiling&#xA;fatally on the magician, that commits an&#xA;error in uttering the spell of power that&#xA;holds it in thrall, it slew Srutayudha and&#xA;laid him dead on the field, like a great&#xA;forest tree blown down by a storm.&#xA;Then the king of Kamboja led his forces&#xA;against Arjuna. After a fierce fight, he lay&#xA;stretched dead on the field like a great&#xA;flagstaff after the festival is over.&#xA;When they saw the strong warriors,&#xA;Srutayudha and the king of Kamboja,&#xA;slain, the Kaurava force was in great&#xA;confusion.&#xA;Srutayu and his brother Asrutayu then&#xA;attacked Partha on both sides trying to&#xA;save the situation, and greatly harassed&#xA;him. At one stage of this battle, Arjunaleaned on the flagstaff, dazed with the&#xA;wounds he received.&#xA;But Krishna spoke to him encouragingly&#xA;and Arjuna recovered and resumed the&#xA;fight, slaying the two brothers as well as&#xA;their two sons who continued the struggle.&#xA;Arjuna marched on and, killing many&#xA;more warriors successfully made his way&#xA;to Jayadratha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN Dhritarashtra heard Sanjaya relate&#xA;the success of Arjuna, he exclaimed: &amp;ldquo;Oh&#xA;Sanjaya! When Janardana came to&#xA;Hastinapura seeking a settlement, I told&#xA;Duryodhana that it was a great&#xA;opportunity and he must not lose it. I told&#xA;him to make peace with his cousins.&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Kesava has come to do us a good turn. Do&#xA;not disregard his advice,&amp;rsquo; I said. But&#xA;Duryodhana heeded not. What Karna and&#xA;Duhsasana said seemed to him better&#xA;advice than mine. The Destroyer entered&#xA;his mind and he sought his own ruin.&#xA;Drona deprecated war, so also did&#xA;Bhishma, Bhurisravas, Kripa and others.&#xA;But my obstinate son would not listen.&#xA;Impelled by inordinate ambition, he got&#xA;entangled in anger and hatred, and invited&#xA;this ruinous war.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;To Dhritarashtra thus lamenting, Sanjaya&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Of what avail are your regrets now?&#xA;The life-giving water has all run to waste&#xA;and you now seek to stop the breach. Why&#xA;did you not prevent the son of Kunti from&#xA;gambling? Had you done the right thing&#xA;then, all this great grief would have been&#xA;stopped at the source. Even later, if you&#xA;had been firm and stopped your son from&#xA;his evil ways, this calamity could have&#xA;been avoided. You saw the evil and yet,&#xA;against your own sound judgment, you&#xA;followed the foolish advice of Karna and&#xA;Sakuni. Kesava, Yudhishthira and Drona&#xA;do not respect you now as they did before.&#xA;Vasudeva now knows that your rectitude&#xA;is only hypocrisy. The Kauravas are now&#xA;doing their utmost as warriors, but they&#xA;are unequal to opposing the strength of&#xA;Arjuna, Krishna, Satyaki and Bhima.&#xA;Duryodhana has not spared himself. He is&#xA;putting forth his utmost strength. It is not&#xA;meet that you should now accuse him or&#xA;his devoted soldiers.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dear Sanjaya, I admit my dereliction of&#xA;duty. What you say is right. No one can&#xA;change the course of fate. Tell me what&#xA;happened. Tell me all, be it ever so&#xA;unpleasant,&amp;rdquo; said the old king convulsed&#xA;with grief. And obedient to the old king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;behest, Sanjaya continued his narration.&#xA;Duryodhana was greatly agitated when he&#xA;saw&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot&#xA;proceeding&#xA;triumphantly towards the Sindhu king. He&#xA;rushed to Drona and complained bitterly:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Arjuna has effected a breach in the great&#xA;army and has advanced to Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;position. Seeing our discomfiture, the&#xA;warriors, protecting the Sindhu king, will&#xA;surely lose heart. They had believed that it&#xA;was impossible for Arjuna to get past you&#xA;and that has now been falsified. He&#xA;advanced before your eyes and nothing&#xA;was done to prevent it. You seem indeed&#xA;bent on helping the Pandavas. I am in&#xA;great distress of mind. Sir, tell me, in what&#xA;matter have I offended you? Why are you&#xA;letting me down in this way? If I had&#xA;known that you would do this, I should&#xA;not have asked Jayadratha to stay here. It&#xA;was a great mistake I committed in not&#xA;letting him go, as he desired, back to his&#xA;own country. If Arjuna attacks him, it is&#xA;not possible for him to escape death.&#xA;Forgive me. I am talking foolishly,&#xA;distracted by grief. Do go in person&#xA;yourself to save the Saindhava.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;To this frantic appeal Drona made answer:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;King, I shall not take offence at your&#xA;thoughtless and unworthy remarks. You&#xA;are like a son to me. Aswatthama himself&#xA;is not dearer! Do what I ask you. Take this&#xA;coat of armor and, donning it, go and stopArjuna. I cannot do so for my presence is&#xA;necessary in this part of the field. See&#xA;there, the clouds of arrows! The Pandava&#xA;army is attacking us in great force.&#xA;Yudhishthira is here unsupported by&#xA;Arjuna and is this not just the opportunity&#xA;we wanted? Our very plan has borne fruit&#xA;and I must now take Yudhishthira&#xA;prisoner and deliver him to you. I cannot&#xA;give up this objective and run after&#xA;Phalguna now. If I go after Arjuna now,&#xA;our battle array will be hopelessly broken&#xA;and we shall be lost. Let me put this armor&#xA;on you. Go in confidence. Do not fear.&#xA;You have valor, skill and experience. This&#xA;coat will protect you against all weapons.&#xA;It will not let any blow pass through your&#xA;body. Go forth to battle, Duryodhana, in&#xA;confidence as Indra did, clad in the armor&#xA;given by Brahma. May victory be yours.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s confidence was restored&#xA;and, as the acharya directed, he went,&#xA;dressed in magic armor and accompanied&#xA;by a large force of soldiers, to attack&#xA;Arjuna.&#xA;Arjuna had crossed the Kaurava army and&#xA;gone far ahead towards where Jayadratha&#xA;had been kept for safety. Seeing that the&#xA;horses were somewhat fatigued, Krishna&#xA;stopped the chariot and was about to&#xA;unyoke the tired animals, when the&#xA;brothers Vinda and Anuvinda came up&#xA;suddenly and began to attack Arjuna.&#xA;They were defeated and Arjuna scattered&#xA;their forces and slew them both. After&#xA;this, Krishna unyoked the chariot and let&#xA;the horses roll in the mud. The horses&#xA;rested for a while and were refreshed.&#xA;Then, they proceeded again according to&#xA;plan.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dhananjaya, look behind! There comes&#xA;the foolhardy Duryodhana. What good&#xA;luck! Long have you suppressed your&#xA;anger, and now is the time for you to let&#xA;yourself go. Here is the man who caused&#xA;all this grief, delivering himself into your&#xA;hands. But remember he is a great archer,&#xA;well-versed in bow lore, and also a keen&#xA;and strong-limbed fighter.&amp;rdquo; Thus said&#xA;Krishna and they halted to give battle to&#xA;the Kaurava.&#xA;Duryodhana approached without fear.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;They say, Arjuna, that you have done&#xA;acts of prowess. I have not seen this&#xA;myself. Let me see if your courage and&#xA;your skill are indeed as great as your&#xA;reputation,&amp;rdquo; said Duryodhana to Arjuna as&#xA;he began to battle.&#xA;The combat was fierce indeed and&#xA;Krishna was surprised.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Partha, I am astonished,&amp;rdquo; said Krishna,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;How is it your arrows do not seem to&#xA;hurt Duryodhana? This is the first time I&#xA;see the shafts proceeding from the&#xA;Gandiva bow strike their targets without&#xA;effect. This is strange, Have your arms&#xA;lost their power? Or has the Gandiva bow&#xA;lost its quality? Why do your arrows strike&#xA;Duryodhana and drop to the ground&#xA;without piercing him? This is most&#xA;puzzling.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna smiled and replied: &amp;ldquo;I understand.&#xA;This man has come dressed by Drona in&#xA;charmed armor. The acharya has taught&#xA;me the secret of this armor, but this man&#xA;wears it as a bullock might do. You will&#xA;see some fun now!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying thus, Arjuna proceeded to shoot&#xA;his arrows, first depriving Duryodhana of&#xA;his horses, his charioteer and his car.&#xA;Then, Arjuna broke his bow and disarmed&#xA;him completely. There after he sent&#xA;needle-eye darts which pierced just those&#xA;parts of Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s body that were not&#xA;covered by armor, until he could bear it no&#xA;longer and turned and fled.&#xA;When Duryodhana was thus discomfited,&#xA;Krishna blew his conch and it sent a thrill&#xA;of fear in Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s army. The warriors&#xA;around the Sindhu king were surprised.&#xA;They at once got ready in their chariots&#xA;and&#xA;Bhurisravas,&#xA;Chala,&#xA;Karna,Vrishasena, Kripa, Salya, Aswatthama&#xA;and Jayadratha, eight of them, arrayed&#xA;their forces against Arjuna.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN the Pandavas saw Duryodhana&#xA;proceeding in the direction of Arjuna, they&#xA;attacked the Kaurava army in force so as&#xA;to hold Drona and prevent him from going&#xA;to Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s rescue.&#xA;So, Dhrishtadyumna led his forces&#xA;repeatedly against Drona. As a result of&#xA;all this, the Kaurava army had to fight on&#xA;three fronts, and was greatly weakened.&#xA;Driving his chariot right against Drona&amp;rsquo;s,&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna attacked him violently.&#xA;Drona&amp;rsquo;s chestnut horses and the Panchala&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;dove-colored ones were entangled with&#xA;one another and presented a picturesque&#xA;sight like the clouds at sunset.&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna threw away his bow and,&#xA;sword and shield in hand, he sprang upon&#xA;Drona&amp;rsquo;s chariot. Now standing on the&#xA;shafts of the vehicle, now on the horses&#xA;and now on the yoke, he attacked Drona&#xA;bewilderingly, all the while seeming to&#xA;scorch him with baleful and bloodshot&#xA;eyes.&#xA;Long did this fight go on. Drona pulled&#xA;his bow in great wrath and sent a shaft,&#xA;which would have drunk the Panchala&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;life but for the unexpected intervention of&#xA;Satyaki who sent an arrow and diverted&#xA;the acharya&amp;rsquo;s shaft.&#xA;Drona then turned and attacked Satyaki,&#xA;which enabled the Panchala warriors to&#xA;take Dhrishtadyumna away. Drona,&#xA;hissing like a black cobra, his eyes red&#xA;with anger, advanced on Satyaki who was&#xA;among the front rank warriors on the&#xA;Pandava side and who, when he saw&#xA;Drona desiring battle, went forward to&#xA;accept the challenge.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Here is the man who, giving up his&#xA;vocation as a brahmana has taken up the&#xA;profession of fighting and is causing&#xA;distress to the Pandavas,&amp;rdquo; Satyaki said to&#xA;his charioteer. &amp;ldquo;This man is the principal&#xA;cause of Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s arrogance. This&#xA;man fancies himself a very great soldier&#xA;and is ever bursting with conceit. I must&#xA;teach him a lesson. Take the chariot up&#xA;quickly.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s charioteer accordingly lashed the&#xA;silver-white horses and took the car at a&#xA;great pace. Satyaki and Drona shot shafts&#xA;at one another so quick that they covered&#xA;the sun, and the battlefield was in&#xA;darkness for a while. The steel shafts&#xA;swished glimmering like newly-sloughed&#xA;snakes rushing about.&#xA;The chariot hoods and the flagstaffs on&#xA;both sides were battered down. Drona as&#xA;well as Satyaki were bleeding profusely.&#xA;The warriors on either side stood still&#xA;watching the duel and they did not blow&#xA;their conchs or raise their war cries or&#xA;sound their lion-roars.&#xA;The Devas, Vidyadharas, Gandharvas and&#xA;Yakshas watched the great battle from&#xA;above. Drona&amp;rsquo;s bow was broken by a well-&#xA;aimed shaft from Satyaki, and the son of&#xA;Bharadwaja had to take another bow and,&#xA;even as he strung it, Satyaki shot it down&#xA;again. Drona took up another bow that&#xA;too was shot down.&#xA;And so it went on till Drona lost a&#xA;hundred and one bows without being able&#xA;to shoot an arrow. The great acharya said&#xA;to himself: &amp;ldquo;This man Satyaki is a warrior&#xA;in the class of Sri Rama, Kartavirya,&#xA;Dhananjaya and Bhishma,&amp;ldquo;and was glad&#xA;he had an opponent worthy of him.&#xA;It was a craftsman&amp;rsquo;s professional joy at&#xA;skill displayed in the art he loved. For&#xA;every specially-charged shaft that Drona&#xA;sent, Satyaki had a ready answer of&#xA;equivalent quality. Long did this equal&#xA;combat continue. Drona of unrivalled skill&#xA;in archery then resolved on killing Satyaki&#xA;and sent the fire astra. But Satyaki saw&#xA;this and, losing no time, sent the Varuna&#xA;astra to counteract it.But now Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s strength began to fail&#xA;and, seeing this, the Kaurava warriors&#xA;were glad and shouted in satisfaction.&#xA;When Yudhishthira saw Satyaki was hard&#xA;pressed, he told those nearby to go to&#xA;Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s relief. &amp;ldquo;Our great and good hero&#xA;Yuyudhana&#xA;(Satyaki)&#xA;is&#xA;being&#xA;overpowered by Drona. You should go&#xA;there at once,&amp;rdquo; he said to Dhrishtadyumna.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The brahmana will otherwise slay&#xA;Satyaki in a few minutes. Why are you&#xA;hesitating? Go at once. Drona is playing&#xA;with Satyaki as a cat plays with a bird.&#xA;Satyaki is indeed in the paws of the&#xA;Destroyer.&amp;rdquo; Yudhishthira ordered the&#xA;army to make a powerful attack on Drona.&#xA;Satyaki was saved with difficulty. Just&#xA;then, the sound of Krishna&amp;rsquo;s conch was&#xA;heard from the sector where Arjuna was&#xA;fighting.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Satyaki, I hear Panchajanya,&amp;rdquo; cried&#xA;Yudhishthira; &amp;ldquo;but the twang of Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;bow does not accompany it. I fear Arjuna&#xA;has been surrounded by Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;friends and is in danger. Arjuna is&#xA;opposed by forces both in front of him&#xA;and in his rear. He pierced the Kaurava&#xA;ranks in the morning and he has not come&#xA;back yet though the greater part of the day&#xA;is gone. How is it that only Krishna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;conch is heard? I fear Dhananjaya has&#xA;been slain and therefore Krishna has taken&#xA;up arms. Satyaki, there is nothing you&#xA;cannot accomplish. Your bosom friend&#xA;Arjuna, he, who taught you, is in mortal&#xA;danger. Often has Arjuna spoken to me&#xA;admiringly of your great skill and&#xA;prowess. &amp;lsquo;There is not another soldier like&#xA;Satyaki,&amp;rsquo; he said to me when we were in&#xA;the forest. Oh, look there! The dust is&#xA;rising that side. I am certain Arjuna has&#xA;been surrounded. Jayadratha is a powerful&#xA;warrior, and there are many enemy&#xA;warriors there helping him and resolved to&#xA;die in defence of him. Go at once,&#xA;Satyaki.&amp;rdquo; Thus did Dharmaputra speak in&#xA;great trepidation.&#xA;Satyaki, who was weary after his battle&#xA;with Drona, replied: &amp;ldquo;Faultless among&#xA;men, I shall obey your command. What&#xA;would I not do for Dhananjaya&amp;rsquo;s sake? My&#xA;life is the merest trifle in my eyes. If you&#xA;order me, I am ready to fight the gods&#xA;themselves. But allow me to put before&#xA;you what the wise Vasudeva and Arjuna&#xA;told me when they left. &amp;lsquo;Until we return&#xA;after slaying Jayadratha you should not&#xA;leave Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s side. Be vigilant in&#xA;protecting him. We entrust this to you in&#xA;confidence and go. There is only one&#xA;warrior in the Kaurava army whom we&#xA;fear, and he is Drona. You know his&#xA;sworn&#xA;intention.&#xA;We&#xA;go&#xA;leaving&#xA;Dharmaputra&amp;rsquo;s safety in our hands.&amp;rsquo; Thus&#xA;said Vasudeva and Arjuna to me when&#xA;they went. Arjuna laid this trust on me,&#xA;believing me fit for it. How can I&#xA;disregard his command? Do not have any&#xA;fear about Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s safety. No one can&#xA;defeat him. The Sindhu king and the&#xA;others cannot cope with a sixteenth part of&#xA;Arjuna. Dharmaputra, to whom shall I&#xA;entrust your safety if I must go? I see no&#xA;one here who can stand against Drona if&#xA;he comes to seize you. Do not ask me to&#xA;go. Consider well before you command&#xA;me to leave.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Satyaki,&amp;rdquo; replied Yudhishthira, &amp;ldquo;I have&#xA;thought over it. As I have weighed the&#xA;danger against the need and I have&#xA;concluded that you must go. You leave&#xA;me with my full permission. Here is the&#xA;powerful Bhima to look to my safety.&#xA;There is Dhrishtadyumna also, and there&#xA;are many others besides. There is no need&#xA;to worry about me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So saying, Yudhishthira placed a boxful&#xA;of arrows and other weapons in Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot and got fresh horses yoked thereto&#xA;and sent Satyaki uttering benedictions on&#xA;him.&amp;ldquo;Bhimasena, Yudhishthira is your charge.&#xA;Be vigilant,&amp;rdquo; said Satyaki, and went to&#xA;join Dhananjaya.&#xA;Satyaki met with violent resistance as he&#xA;proceeded to dash through the Kaurava&#xA;forces. But he cut his way through bearing&#xA;down all opposition. But the resistance&#xA;was very stiff and his progress was slow.&#xA;When Drona saw Satyaki part from&#xA;Yudhishthira, he began to assault the&#xA;Pandava formation without rest or&#xA;interval, until it began to break and retreat.&#xA;Yudhishthira was greatly agitated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;ARJUNA has not returned, nor has&#xA;Satyaki, who was sent after him. Bhima,&#xA;my fear grows. I hear the Panchajanya,&#xA;but not the twang of Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s bowstring.&#xA;Satyaki, that bravest and most loyal of&#xA;friends, has not come back with any&#xA;tidings. My anxiety is increasing every&#xA;moment,&amp;rdquo; said Yudhishthira to Bhima in&#xA;great perplexity of mind.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have never seen you so agitated,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;replied Bhimasena. &amp;ldquo;Do, not let your&#xA;fortitude grow less. Command me as you&#xA;please. Do not let the wheels of your mind&#xA;stick in the mud of anxiety.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dearest Bhima, I fear your brother has&#xA;been slain, and it seems to me Madhava&#xA;has now himself taken up arms. I hear the&#xA;conch of Madhava but I hear not the&#xA;resounding twang of Gandiva. I fear&#xA;Dhananjaya, the unrivalled hero, in whom&#xA;were centerd all our hopes, has been&#xA;killed. My mind is confused. If you would&#xA;do as I tell you, go at once to where&#xA;Arjuna is. Join him and Satyaki, and do&#xA;what needs to be done, and come back.&#xA;Satyaki, under orders from me, pierced&#xA;the Kaurava ranks and proceeded in the&#xA;direction of Arjuna. You go now, and do&#xA;likewise and, if you indeed see them alive,&#xA;I shall know it by your lion-roar.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My Lord, do not grieve. I shall go and let&#xA;you know they are safe,&amp;rdquo; said Bhima, and&#xA;immediately turning to Dhrishtadyumna&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Panchala, you know very well that&#xA;Drona is seeking, by some means or other,&#xA;to seize Dharmaputra alive. Our foremost&#xA;duty is to protect the King. But I must also&#xA;obey him and fulfil his command. And so&#xA;I go, trusting him to your care.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Bhima, do not be concerned. Go with an&#xA;assured mind. Drona cannot take&#xA;Yudhishthira without first killing me,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said the heroic son of Drupada, sworn&#xA;enemy of Drona. And Bhima hurried&#xA;away.&#xA;The Kauravas surrounded Bhima in full&#xA;force and vowed to prevent him from&#xA;going to Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s relief. But like a lion&#xA;scattering less noble beasts he put his&#xA;enemies to flight, killing no less than&#xA;eleven of the sons of Dhritarashtra. Bhima&#xA;then approached Drona himself. &amp;ldquo;Stop,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;cried Drona. &amp;ldquo;Here I am, your enemy.&#xA;You cannot proceed further without&#xA;defeating me. Your brother Arjuna went&#xA;in with my consent. But I cannot let you&#xA;go.&amp;rdquo; Drona spoke thus believing that he&#xA;would receive the same courtesy from&#xA;Bhima as he did from Arjuna. But Bhima&#xA;was furious at hearing these words of&#xA;Drona, and answered scornfully.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh brahmana, it was not with your&#xA;permission that Arjuna went. He broke&#xA;your resistance and pierced your battle&#xA;lines fighting his way through, but he did&#xA;not hurt you out of pity. But I shall not,&#xA;like Arjuna, show mercy to you. I am your&#xA;enemy. Once upon a time, you were our&#xA;preceptor and were like a father to us. We&#xA;respected you as such. Now, you have&#xA;yourself said you are our enemy. May it&#xA;be so!&amp;rdquo; Saying this, Bhima aimed his&#xA;mace at Drona&amp;rsquo;s chariot that crumbled to&#xA;pieces. And Drona had to take to another&#xA;chariot.&#xA;The second chariot too was broken to&#xA;pieces. And Bhima forced his way&#xA;through overcoming all opposition. Dronalost eight chariots that day. And the army&#xA;of the Bhojas, that tried to stop Bhima,&#xA;was completely destroyed.&#xA;He proceeded mowing down all&#xA;opposition and reached where Arjuna was&#xA;fighting Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s forces.&#xA;As soon as he saw Arjuna, Bhima roared&#xA;like a lion. Hearing that roar, Krishna and&#xA;Arjuna were exceedingly pleased and&#xA;raised yells of joy. Yudhishthira heard&#xA;these roars and, relieved of his doubts and&#xA;anxieties, he pronounced blessings on&#xA;Arjuna. And he thought within himself:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Before the sun sets today, Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s oath&#xA;will be fulfilled. He will slay the man who&#xA;caused Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s death and will return&#xA;in triumph. Duryodhana may sue for&#xA;peace after Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s death. Seeing so&#xA;many of his brothers slain, it is possible&#xA;that foolish Duryodhana may see light.&#xA;The lives of numerous kings and great&#xA;warriors have been sacrificed on the field&#xA;of battle and even the stubborn and&#xA;narrow-visioned Duryodhana may now&#xA;see his fault and ask for peace. Will this&#xA;indeed happen? The great grandsire&#xA;Bhishma has been offered as a sacrifice.&#xA;Will this wicked enmity end with it and&#xA;shall we be saved from further cruel&#xA;destruction?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;While thus Yudhishthira was fondly&#xA;hoping and dreaming of peace, the battle&#xA;was raging with great fury where Bhima,&#xA;Satyaki and Arjuna were engaging the&#xA;enemy.&#xA;Only the Lord knows through what travail&#xA;the world must evolve. His ways are&#xA;inscrutable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ARJUNA had left Yudhishthira behind to&#xA;repel Drona&amp;rsquo;s attacks and had gone to&#xA;make good his word that before sunset&#xA;Jayadratha would lie dead on the field of&#xA;battle.&#xA;Jayadratha had been the main cause of&#xA;Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s death. He it was who had&#xA;effectively prevented the relief of&#xA;Abhimanyu by the Pandavas, and thereby&#xA;caused Abhimanyu to be isolated,&#xA;overpowered and slain.&#xA;We have seen how Yudhishthira in his&#xA;anxiety sent first Satyaki and then Bhima&#xA;to join Arjuna in his battle against&#xA;Jayadratha. Bhima reached where Arjuna&#xA;was engaged and sounded his simhanada&#xA;(lion-roar). Dharmaputra heard the lion-&#xA;roar of Bhima and knew that Arjuna was&#xA;found alive.&#xA;It was the fourteenth day and the battle&#xA;raged fiercely at many points, between&#xA;Satyaki and Bhurisravas at one place,&#xA;between Bhima and Karna at another and&#xA;between Arjuna and Jayadratha at a third.&#xA;Drona remained at the main front resisting&#xA;the attack of the Panchalas and the&#xA;Pandavas, and leading a counter-offensive&#xA;against them.&#xA;Duryodhana arrived with his forces at the&#xA;sector where Arjuna attacked Jayadratha,&#xA;but was soon defeated and turned back.&#xA;The battle thus raged long and furiously&#xA;on more than one front. The armies were&#xA;so deployed that each side was exposed to&#xA;danger in its rear.&#xA;Duryodhana was speaking to Drona:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Arjuna, Bhima and Satyaki have treated&#xA;us with contempt and proceeded&#xA;successfully to Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s sector and&#xA;they are pressing hard on the Sindhu king.&#xA;It is indeed strange that, under your&#xA;command, our battle array should have&#xA;been broken and our plans completely&#xA;foiled. Everyone asks how it is that the&#xA;great Drona with all his mastery of the&#xA;science of war has been so badly&#xA;outmaneuvered. What answer shall I&#xA;make? I have been betrayed by you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana thus, once again, bitterly&#xA;reproached&#xA;Drona,&#xA;who&#xA;replied&#xA;unperturbed:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Duryodhana, your accusations are as&#xA;unworthy as they are contrary to truth.There is nothing to be gained by talking&#xA;about what is past and beyond repair.&#xA;Think of what is to be done now.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sir, it is for you to advise me. Tell me&#xA;what should be done. Give your best&#xA;consideration to the difficulties of the&#xA;situation and decide and let us do it&#xA;quickly.&amp;rdquo; Puzzled and perplexed, thus did&#xA;Duryodhana plead.&#xA;Drona replied: &amp;ldquo;My son, the situation is no&#xA;doubt serious. Three great generals have&#xA;advanced, outmanoeuvring us. But they&#xA;have as much reason to be anxious as we,&#xA;for their rear is now left as open to attack&#xA;as ours. We are on both sides of them and&#xA;their position is not therefore safe. Be&#xA;heartened, go up to Jayadratha again, and&#xA;do all you can to support him. It is of no&#xA;avail to dishearten oneself by dwelling on&#xA;past defeats and difficulties. It is best I&#xA;stay here and send you reinforcements as&#xA;and when required. I must keep the&#xA;Panchalas and Pandava army engaged&#xA;here. Otherwise, we shall be wholly&#xA;destroyed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accordingly, Duryodhana went with fresh&#xA;reinforcements again to where Arjuna was&#xA;directing his attack on Jayadratha.&#xA;The narrative of the fourteenth day&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;fighting at Kurukshetra shows that, even&#xA;in the Mahabharata times, the modern&#xA;tactics of turning and enveloping&#xA;movements was not unknown.&#xA;The advantages and risks of such strategy&#xA;appear to have been fully understood and&#xA;discussed even in those days. Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;flanking&#xA;manoeuvres&#xA;perplexed&#xA;his&#xA;enemies greatly. The story of that day&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;battle between Bhima and Karna reads&#xA;very much like a chapter from the&#xA;narrative of a modern war.&#xA;Bhima did not desire to fight Karna or&#xA;remain long engaged with him. He was&#xA;eager to reach where Arjuna was. But&#xA;Radheya would, by no means, permit him&#xA;to do this. He showered his arrows on&#xA;Bhimasena and stopped him from&#xA;proceeding.&#xA;The contrast between the two warriors&#xA;was striking. Karna&amp;rsquo;s handsome lotus-like&#xA;face was radiant with smiles when he&#xA;attacked Bhima saying: &amp;ldquo;Do not show&#xA;your back,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Now, do not flee like a&#xA;coward,&amp;rdquo; and so on.&#xA;Bhima was all anger when taunted in this&#xA;manner. He was maddened by Karna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;smiles. The battle was fierce but Karna&#xA;did everything with a smiling air of ease&#xA;whereas Bhima&amp;rsquo;s face glowed with rage&#xA;and his movements were violent.&#xA;Karna would keep at a distance and send&#xA;his well-aimed shafts but Bhima would&#xA;disregard the arrows and javelins failing&#xA;thick upon him and always try to close&#xA;with Karna.&#xA;Radheya did everything he did, calmly&#xA;and&#xA;with&#xA;graceful&#xA;ease,&#xA;whereas&#xA;Bhimasena fumed and fretted with&#xA;impatience, as he showed his amazing&#xA;strength of limb.&#xA;Bhima was red with bleeding wounds all&#xA;over and presented the appearance of an&#xA;Asoka tree in full blossom. But he minded&#xA;them not, as he attacked Karna cutting&#xA;bows in twain and smashing his chariot.&#xA;When Karna had to run for a fresh chariot,&#xA;there was no smile on his face. For anger&#xA;rose in him, like the sea on a full moon&#xA;day, as he attacked Bhima. Both showed&#xA;the strength of tigers and the speed of&#xA;eagles and their anger was now like that&#xA;of serpents in a fury.&#xA;Bhima brought before his mind all the&#xA;insults and injuries which he and his&#xA;brothers and Draupadi had suffered, and&#xA;fought desperately, caring not for life.&#xA;The two cars dashed against each other&#xA;and the milk white horses of Karna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot and Bhimasena&amp;rsquo;s black horses&#xA;jostled in the combat like clouds in a&#xA;thunderstorm.Karna&amp;rsquo;s bow was shattered and his&#xA;charioteer reeled and fell. Karna then&#xA;hurled a javelin at Bhima. But Bhima&#xA;parried it and continued pouring his&#xA;arrows on Karna, who had taken up a&#xA;fresh bow.&#xA;Again and again did Karna lose his&#xA;chariot. Duryodhana saw Karna&amp;rsquo;s plight&#xA;and calling his brother Durjaya said: &amp;ldquo;This&#xA;wicked Pandava will kill Karna. Go at&#xA;once and attack Bhima and save Karna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;life.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Durjaya went as ordered and attacked&#xA;Bhima who, in a rage sent seven shafts&#xA;which sent Durjaya&amp;rsquo;s horses and his&#xA;charioteer to the abode of Yama and&#xA;Durjaya himself fell mortally wounded.&#xA;Seeing his bleeding body wriggling on the&#xA;ground like a wounded snake, Karna was&#xA;overwhelmed with grief and circled round&#xA;the hero, paying mournful honor to the&#xA;dead.&#xA;Bhima did not stop but continued the fight&#xA;and greatly harassed Karna. Karna once&#xA;again had to find a fresh chariot. He sent&#xA;well aimed shafts and hit Bhima who in a&#xA;fury hurled his mace at Karna and it&#xA;crashed on Karna&amp;rsquo;s chariot and killed his&#xA;charioteer and horses and broke the&#xA;flagstaff. Karna now stood on the ground&#xA;with bent bow.&#xA;Duryodhana now sent another brother to&#xA;relieve&#xA;Karna.&#xA;Durmukha&#xA;went&#xA;accordingly and took Karna on his chariot.&#xA;Seeing yet another son of Dhritarashtra&#xA;come to offer himself up to death, Bhima&#xA;licked his lips in gusto and sent nine&#xA;shafts on the newly arrived enemy. And,&#xA;even as Karna climbed up to take his seat&#xA;in the chariot, Durmukha&amp;rsquo;s armor was&#xA;broken and he fell lifeless.&#xA;When Karna saw the warrior bathed in&#xA;blood and lying dead by his side, he was&#xA;again overwhelmed with grief and stood&#xA;motionless for a while.&#xA;Bhima relentlessly continued his attack on&#xA;Karna. His sharp arrows pierced Karna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;coat of armor and he was in pain.&#xA;But he too at once returned the attack and&#xA;wounded Bhima all over.&#xA;Still the Pandava would not stop and&#xA;attacked Karna furiously. The sight of so&#xA;many of Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s brothers dying for&#xA;his sake one after another was too much&#xA;for Karna.&#xA;This, and the physical pain of his own&#xA;wounds made him lose courage and he&#xA;turned away defeated. But, when Bhima&#xA;stood up on the field of battle red with&#xA;wounds all over like a flaming fire and&#xA;emitted a triumphant yell, he could not&#xA;brook it but returned to the combat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHRITARASHTRA, hearing of the&#xA;slaughter of his sons and the check&#xA;received by Karna, was desolate. &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;Sanjaya, like moths falling in the fire, my&#xA;sons are being destroyed. The stubborn&#xA;Duryodhana has led the lads Durmukha&#xA;and Durjaya, to their doom. Alas, I have&#xA;lost these boys! The fool said: &amp;lsquo;Karna,&#xA;unrivalled among men for courage and the&#xA;accomplishment of war, is on our side.&#xA;Who then can defeat us? Even the gods&#xA;cannot win a battle against me when&#xA;Karna is on my side. What can these&#xA;Pandavas do to me?&amp;rsquo; But now he has seen&#xA;Karna beating a retreat when Bhimasena&#xA;attacked him. Has he seen wisdom at least&#xA;now? Alas, Sanjaya, my son has earned&#xA;the undying hatred of the son of Vayu,&#xA;Bhima, who has the strength of the god of&#xA;death! We are indeed ruined!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sanjaya replied: &amp;ldquo;O king, was it not you&#xA;who brought about this unquenchable&#xA;hatred, listening to the words of your&#xA;foolish and stubborn son? To you indeed&#xA;must be traced this greater disaster. You&#xA;are now but reaping the fruit of your&#xA;discarding the advice of Bhishma and the&#xA;other elders. Blame yourself, king. Do notblame Karna and the brave warriors who&#xA;have done their best in battle.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After thus admonishing the blind king,&#xA;Sanjaya proceeded to tell him what&#xA;happened. Five sons of Dhritarashtra,&#xA;Durmarsha, Dussaha, Durmata, Durdhara&#xA;and Jaya, when they saw Karna put to&#xA;flight by Bhima at once rushed on the&#xA;latter.&#xA;When Karna saw this, he was heartened&#xA;and turned back to resume his attack.&#xA;Bhimasena at first ignored the sons of&#xA;Dhritarashtra and concentrated on Karna.&#xA;But they became so violent in their assault&#xA;that Bhima got incensed and, turning his&#xA;attentions on them, disposed of all five of&#xA;them. They lay dead on the field, with&#xA;their horses and their charioteers.&#xA;The young warriors with their bleeding&#xA;wounds presented the appearance of a&#xA;forest with trees, uprooted by a strong&#xA;wind and lying flat on the ground with&#xA;their beautiful red blossoms.&#xA;When Karna saw another batch of princes&#xA;slaughtered for his sake he fought more&#xA;grimly than ever before. Bhima too was&#xA;more violent than before, thinking of all&#xA;the evil that Karna had wrought against&#xA;the Pandavas.&#xA;He used his bow so as to disarm Karna&#xA;completely. His horses and charioteer&#xA;were also laid low. Karna now jumped&#xA;down from his chariot and hurled his&#xA;mace at Bhima.&#xA;But Bhima warded it off with shafts from&#xA;his powerful bow and covered Karna with&#xA;a shower of arrows and forced him to turn&#xA;back and walk on foot.&#xA;Duryodhana, who watched this combat,&#xA;was greatly grieved and sent seven of his&#xA;brothers Chitra, Upachitra, Chitraksha,&#xA;Charuchitra, Sarasana, Chitrayudha and&#xA;Chitravarman, to relieve Radheya.&#xA;They gave battle to Bhima displaying&#xA;great skill and energy. But fell dead one&#xA;after another, for Bhima&amp;rsquo;s passion was&#xA;roused and his attack was irresistible.&#xA;When Karna saw so many of the sons of&#xA;Dhritarashtra sacrificing themselves for&#xA;him, his face was wet with tears and he&#xA;mounted a fresh chariot and began to&#xA;attack Bhima with deadly effect.&#xA;The two combatants clashed like clouds in&#xA;a thunderstorm. Kesava, Satyaki and&#xA;Arjuna were filled with admiration and&#xA;joy as they watched Bhima fighting.&#xA;Bhurisravas, Kripacharya, Aswatthama,&#xA;Salya, Jayadratha and many other warriors&#xA;of the Kaurava army also broke into&#xA;exclamations, astonished at the way in&#xA;which Bhima fought.&#xA;Duryodhana was stung to the quick and&#xA;burned with anger. Karna&amp;rsquo;s plight caused&#xA;him extreme anxiety. He feared Bhima&#xA;would kill Radheya that day, and sent&#xA;seven more of his brothers directing them&#xA;to surround Bhima and attack him&#xA;simultaneously.&#xA;The seven brothers sent by Duryodhana&#xA;attacked Bhima. But fell one after another,&#xA;struck down by his arrows. Vikarna, who&#xA;was killed last, was beloved of all.&#xA;When Bhima saw him fall dead after a&#xA;brave fight, he was deeply moved and&#xA;exclaimed: &amp;ldquo;Alas, O Vikarna, you were&#xA;just and knew what was dharma! You&#xA;fought in loyal obedience to the call of&#xA;duty. I had to kill even you. Indeed this&#xA;battle is a curse upon us wherein men like&#xA;you and the grandsire Bhishma have had&#xA;to be slaughtered.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Seeing Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s brothers, who came&#xA;to help him, slain one after another in this&#xA;manner, Karna was overwhelmed by&#xA;anguish. He leant back on his seat in the&#xA;chariot and closed his eyes unable to bear&#xA;the sight.&#xA;Then recovering control over his emotions&#xA;he hardened his heart and began again his&#xA;attack on Bhima. Bow after bow wasbroken up by Bhimasena&amp;rsquo;s shaft, but&#xA;Karna kept the battle.&#xA;Eighteen times he had to take up a fresh&#xA;bow. Karna had long ago discarded his&#xA;smile and his face showed savage anger&#xA;even as Bhima&amp;rsquo;s. They now glared fiercely&#xA;at each other as they fought.&#xA;Yudhishthira now heard Bhima&amp;rsquo;s roar rise&#xA;above the tumult of battle, and heartened&#xA;by it, he fought Drona with increased&#xA;vigor.&#xA;In the renewed and fierce battle between&#xA;Bhima and Karna, Bhima lost his horses&#xA;and charioteer. Soon his chariot also was&#xA;smashed to pieces. Then, Bhima hurled&#xA;his spear at Karna who was in his chariot&#xA;and as Karna parried it with his shaft,&#xA;Bhima advanced with sword and shield.&#xA;But Karna broke the shield at once with&#xA;his shafts. Then, Bhima whirled his sword&#xA;and hurled it, and it cut Karna&amp;rsquo;s bow into&#xA;two and fell on the ground. But Karna&#xA;took up yet another bow and assailed&#xA;Bhima with arrows more fiercely than&#xA;before.&#xA;Bhima, in a fit of uncontrollable rage,&#xA;sprang upon Karna. Radheya took cover&#xA;behind&#xA;his&#xA;flagstaff&#xA;and&#xA;escaped&#xA;destruction. Thereupon, Bhima jumped&#xA;out of Karna&amp;rsquo;s car down into the field of&#xA;battle where, deprived of all arms, he used&#xA;the elephants lying dead on the ground to&#xA;protect himself from Karna&amp;rsquo;s arrows and&#xA;continued the fight.&#xA;He picked up anything he could lay hands&#xA;upon, wheels of broken chariots, the limbs&#xA;of horses and elephants that were lying&#xA;about, and hurling them at Karna, kept&#xA;him engaged without interval. But this&#xA;could not long continue and Bhima was&#xA;soon at a great disadvantage. Karna said&#xA;exultingly:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Foolish glutton, you do not know the&#xA;science of war; why do you engage&#xA;yourself in battle here? Go to the jungle&#xA;and fill yourself with fruits and roots and&#xA;grow fat. You are a savage, not fit for&#xA;kshatriya battle. Get away!&amp;rdquo; Hurling&#xA;insulting taunts at him, he made the&#xA;helpless Bhima burn with rage, but&#xA;mindful of his word to Kunti, refrained&#xA;from killing him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;There, Arjuna! See how poor Bhima is&#xA;being harassed by Karna,&amp;rdquo; said Krishna.&#xA;Dhananjaya&amp;rsquo;s eyes burned red with wrath,&#xA;when he saw the plight of his valiant&#xA;brother.&#xA;He bent his Gandiva bow and discharged&#xA;his arrows on Karna who then gladly&#xA;turned his attentions from Bhima to&#xA;Arjuna. He had pledged his word to Kunti&#xA;not to kill more than one of the Pandavas&#xA;and he reserved that option for the great&#xA;Arjuna.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;THERE comes the valorous Satyaki,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said&#xA;Krishna,&#xA;the&#xA;charioteer,&#xA;to&#xA;Dhananjaya. &amp;ldquo;Your disciple and friend is&#xA;marching&#xA;up,&#xA;triumphantly&#xA;breaking&#xA;through enemy ranks.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I do not like it, Madhava,&amp;rdquo; replied&#xA;Arjuna. &amp;ldquo;It was not right for him to have&#xA;left Dharmaputra and come here to join&#xA;me. Drona is there ever seeking an&#xA;opportunity to seize Dharmaputra. Satyaki&#xA;should have stuck to his post there to&#xA;guard him. Instead, he has come here. Old&#xA;Bhurisravas has intercepted Satyaki. It&#xA;was a great mistake for Yudhishthira to&#xA;have sent Satyaki away here.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;There was a family feud between&#xA;Bhurisravas and Satyaki that made them&#xA;inveterate foes.&#xA;It had come about this way. When Devaki,&#xA;who was to be the blessed mother of Sri&#xA;Krishna, was a maiden, many princes&#xA;competed for her hand and there was a&#xA;great battle between Somadatta and Sini&#xA;over it.&#xA;Sini won, and on behalf of Vasudeva he&#xA;placed Devaki in his chariot and took her&#xA;away. Since that incident there was feudbetween the two clans, the Sini family and&#xA;that of Somadatta. Satyaki was Sini&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;grandson.&#xA;Bhurisravas was Somadatta&amp;rsquo;s son. When&#xA;they found themselves on opposite sides&#xA;in the Kurukshetra battle, it was natural&#xA;that, as soon as Bhurisravas saw Satyaki,&#xA;the old warrior challenged Satyaki to&#xA;battle.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh Satyaki,&amp;rdquo; cried Bhurisravas, &amp;ldquo;I know&#xA;you strut about thinking yourself a man of&#xA;great prowess. Here now I have you in my&#xA;power and will presently finish you. Long&#xA;have I sought for this meeting. Like&#xA;Indrajit&#xA;destroyed&#xA;Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;son&#xA;Lakshmana, you will die today and go to&#xA;the abode of Yama, gladdening the hearts&#xA;of many a bereaved widow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Satyaki laughed. &amp;ldquo;Have done with your&#xA;vaunting,&amp;rdquo; he interrupted. &amp;ldquo;Words are not&#xA;deeds and do not frighten fighting men.&#xA;Demonstrate your valor in action and do&#xA;not indulge in dry thunder like autumn&#xA;clouds.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After this exchange of words, the battle&#xA;began, and the combat was as between&#xA;two fierce lions. Their horses were killed,&#xA;their bows were broken, and both were&#xA;rendered chariotless.&#xA;They were now standing on the ground&#xA;fighting with swords and shields, till their&#xA;shields were hacked to bits and their&#xA;swords broken. Then they were locked in&#xA;a deadly embrace without weapons.&#xA;They rolled together on the ground. They&#xA;leaped up and they sprang on each other.&#xA;They fell down again and so the combat&#xA;went on for a long while.&#xA;Partha&amp;rsquo;s mind was at the time concentrated&#xA;on Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s movements and he did not&#xA;watch this combat between Satyaki and&#xA;the son of Somadatta.&#xA;But his charioteer Krishna was deeply&#xA;concerned about Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s fate. For&#xA;Krishna knew about their family feud.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dhananjaya,&amp;rdquo; said Krishna, &amp;ldquo;Satyaki is&#xA;exhausted. Bhurisravas is going to kill&#xA;him now.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Still&#xA;Arjuna&#xA;was&#xA;following&#xA;only&#xA;Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s movements.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Satyaki who came after an exhausting&#xA;battle with the Kaurava forces has been&#xA;forced to accept Bhurisravas&amp;rsquo; challenge,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Krishna again. &amp;ldquo;It is a most unequal&#xA;battle. Unless we help him, beloved&#xA;Yuyudhana will be slain.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Even as Krishna was saying this,&#xA;Bhurisravas lifted Satyaki up and brought&#xA;him crashing to the ground and all the&#xA;men around in the Kaurava army&#xA;exclaimed: &amp;ldquo;Yuyudhana is dead!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Again Krishna importuned: &amp;ldquo;Satyaki is&#xA;lying almost dead on the field, the best&#xA;among the Vrishni clan. One who came to&#xA;help you, is being killed before your eyes.&#xA;You are looking on, doing nothing.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhurisravas caught hold of the prostrate&#xA;Satyaki and dragged him on the ground as&#xA;a lion drags its elephant prey.&#xA;Arjuna was in a great conflict of mind.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Bhurisravas has not been called to battle&#xA;by me, nor has he challenged me to fight.&#xA;How can I send my shaft at Bhurisravas&#xA;when he is engaged with another? My&#xA;mind recoils from such an act, although it&#xA;is true a friend who came to help me is&#xA;being slaughtered before my eyes.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Just as Arjuna finished saying this to&#xA;Krishna, the sky was darkened by a cloud&#xA;of arrows sent by Jayadratha. Arjuna&#xA;replied with a shower of arrows, but he&#xA;constantly turned with pain to where&#xA;Satyaki was in the mortal grip of&#xA;Bhurisravas.&#xA;Krishna again pressed Arjuna to consider&#xA;Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s condition. &amp;ldquo;O Partha, Satyaki&#xA;has lost all his weapons and he is now in&#xA;Bhurisravas&amp;rsquo; power, helpless.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Arjuna turned, he saw Bhurisravas&#xA;with his foot on the prostrate body of&#xA;Satyaki and sword upraised to slay him.Before Bhurisravas could deliver the fatal&#xA;thrust, Arjuna shot an arrow which went&#xA;with the speed of lightning and the next&#xA;moment the uplifted arm fell chopped off&#xA;to the ground still holding the sword.&#xA;Bhurisravas, all amazed, turned and saw&#xA;who had done it.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Son of Kunti,&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;I had not&#xA;expected this of you! It befits not a&#xA;warrior to shoot from behind in this&#xA;manner. I was engaged in combat with&#xA;someone else and you have attacked me&#xA;without notice. Indeed, then, no man can&#xA;resist the evil influence of the company he&#xA;keeps, as your unchivalrous conduct&#xA;proves. Dhananjaya, when you go back to&#xA;your brother Dharmaputra, what account&#xA;are you going to give him of this valorous&#xA;deed. Ah! Who taught you this low trick,&#xA;Arjuna? Did you learn this from your&#xA;father Indra or from your teachers Drona&#xA;and Kripa? What code of conduct was it&#xA;that permitted you to shoot your arrow at&#xA;a man who was engaged in combat with&#xA;another and could not so much as turn his&#xA;eyes on you? You have done the deed of a&#xA;low-bred fellow and foully besmirched&#xA;your honor. You must have been&#xA;instigated into it by the son of Vasudeva.&#xA;It was not in your own nature to do it. No&#xA;one with princely blood in his veins would&#xA;think of such a dastardly deed. I know you&#xA;have been incited to it by that&#xA;contemptible Krishna.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus did Bhurisravas with his right arm&#xA;cut off, bitterly denounce Krishna and&#xA;Arjuna in the Kurukshetra field.&#xA;Said Partha: &amp;ldquo;Bhurisravas, you are old and&#xA;age seems to have affected your judgment.&#xA;You accuse Hrishikesa and me without&#xA;cause. How could I look on doing nothing,&#xA;when, before my eyes, you were in the act&#xA;of killing my friend, who came and risked&#xA;his life in battle on my behalf, one who&#xA;was like a right hand to me, and whom&#xA;you were going to stab when he was lying&#xA;helpless on the ground? I would have&#xA;deserved to go to hell if I had failed to&#xA;intervene. You say, I have been ruined by&#xA;keeping company with Madhava. Who in&#xA;the wide world would not wish to be so&#xA;ruined? You have spoken out of confused&#xA;understanding. Satyaki who was weary&#xA;and exhausted when he came here and&#xA;who was inadequately armed, was&#xA;challenged by you to give battle. You&#xA;overcame him. Having been defeated, he&#xA;lay on the ground, powerless. What code&#xA;of honor enabled you to raise your sword&#xA;to thrust it into the body of the fallen&#xA;warrior and slay him? Do I not remember&#xA;how you cheered the man who killed my&#xA;boy&#xA;Abhimanyu&#xA;when&#xA;he&#xA;stood&#xA;staggering, exhausted and weaponless, his&#xA;coat of armor torn off?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhurisravas who heard this did not answer&#xA;but spread his arrows on the ground with&#xA;his left hand and made a seat for&#xA;meditation.&#xA;The old warrior sat in yoga and the sight&#xA;deeply moved all the Kaurava soldiers.&#xA;They cheered Bhurisravas and uttered&#xA;reproaches against Krishna and Arjuna.&#xA;Arjuna spoke: &amp;ldquo;Brave men, I am sworn to&#xA;protect every friend within bow-shot of&#xA;me and I cannot let an enemy kill him. It&#xA;is my sacred pledge. Why do you blame&#xA;me? It is not right to hurl reproaches&#xA;without due thought.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After saying this to the warriors in the&#xA;field who reproached him, he turned to&#xA;Bhurisravas and said: &amp;ldquo;O excellent among&#xA;brave men, you have protected many who&#xA;have gone to you for help. You know that&#xA;what has happened is due to your own&#xA;error. There is no justice in blaming me. If&#xA;you like, let us all blame the violence&#xA;which governs kshatriya life.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhurisravas, who heard this, lowered his&#xA;head in salutation.&#xA;Satyaki now recovered consciousness and&#xA;rose. Carried away by the impetuosity ofhis passion, he picked up a sword and,&#xA;advancing to Bhurisravas, sitting in yoga&#xA;on his seat of arrows, even when all&#xA;around were shouting in horror and before&#xA;Krishna and Arjuna, who rushed to the&#xA;spot, could prevent him, with one swift&#xA;and powerful cut, he struck off the old&#xA;warrior&amp;rsquo;s head which rolled down, while&#xA;the body was still in the posture of&#xA;meditation.&#xA;The gods and the siddhas, who looked on&#xA;from above the battlefield, uttered&#xA;blessings on Bhurisravas. Everyone in the&#xA;field condemned Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s act.&#xA;Satyaki maintained he was right, saying:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;After I fell down senseless, this enemy of&#xA;my family placed his foot on my prostrate&#xA;figure and attempted to kill me. I may slay&#xA;him in whatever posture he might choose&#xA;to be.&amp;rdquo; But none approved of his conduct.&#xA;The slaying of Bhurisravas is one of the&#xA;many situations of moral conflict woven&#xA;into the story of the Mahabharata to&#xA;demonstrate that, when hatred and anger&#xA;have been roused, codes of honor and&#xA;dharma are powerless to control them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;THE decisive hour has come, Karna,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Duryodhana, &amp;ldquo;If before nightfall this&#xA;day Jayadratha is not slain, Arjuna will be&#xA;disgraced and he will kill himself, for not&#xA;having redeemed his oath. With Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;death, the destruction of the Pandavas is&#xA;certain and this kingdom will be ours in&#xA;unquestioned and absolute sovereignty.&#xA;Dhananjaya swore this impossible oath in&#xA;a moment of thoughtlessness, because the&#xA;gods had willed it that he should be thus&#xA;destroyed by his own hand. It seems my&#xA;stars are now in the ascendant. We should&#xA;not let this opportunity slip. We must see&#xA;somehow that his challenge fails. The&#xA;whole thing depends on you. Your great&#xA;skill in battle is on trial today. Prove&#xA;yourself this day. See the sun has sloped&#xA;down in the west. Within the little time&#xA;left before nightfall, I do not think it&#xA;possible for Partha to reach Jayadratha.&#xA;You, Aswatthama, Salya, Kripa, and I&#xA;must guard Jayadratha and do all we can&#xA;to see that he does not fall into Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;hands during the next few hours before&#xA;sunset.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My king,&amp;rdquo; Karna replied &amp;ldquo;I have been&#xA;wounded all over by Bhimasena, and am&#xA;so weary that my limbs have no power in&#xA;them. Still, I shall put forth all the strength&#xA;that is in me. I only live to serve you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Karna and Duryodhana were thus&#xA;planning, Arjuna was engaged in a great&#xA;attack on the Kaurava army and putting&#xA;forth all his strength, so that before sunset&#xA;he could break through to Jayadratha.&#xA;Krishna put his Panchajanya in his mouth&#xA;and blew a loud note in the rishabha&#xA;swara, which was the signal for his own&#xA;charioteer Daruka to arrive at once with&#xA;his chariot.&#xA;When it came, Satyaki took his place in it,&#xA;and attacked Karna vigorously and&#xA;skilfully, keeping him fully engaged.&#xA;Daruka&amp;rsquo;s mastery of driving and Satyaki&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;archery were such as brought down the&#xA;gods to witness the combat.&#xA;Karna&amp;rsquo;s four chariot horses were disabled&#xA;and the charioteer was unseated. Then the&#xA;flagstaff was cut asunder and the chariot&#xA;was smashed. The great Karna stood&#xA;chariotless and the event produced a great&#xA;flutter in the Kaurava army.&#xA;Karna had to run and climb up into&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s chariot. Sanjaya here tells&#xA;Dhritarashtra to whom he was relating the&#xA;incident: &amp;ldquo;The greatest adepts in archery&#xA;are Krishna, Partha and Satyaki. There is&#xA;not a fourth to match them!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna broke through the Kaurava&#xA;opposition and reached Jayadratha.&#xA;Inflamed by the thought of the slaughter&#xA;of Abhimanyu, and all the great wrongs&#xA;inflicted by the Kauravas, Arjuna fought&#xA;with fury.Savyasachin as he was, he discharged&#xA;shafts from the Gandiva bow, now using&#xA;one hand and now the other. He struck&#xA;terror and confusion among his enemies,&#xA;who felt as if Death had come to the&#xA;battlefield with wide-open jaws.&#xA;It is only the poet of the Mahabharata that&#xA;can describe the combat that raged&#xA;between Arjuna and Aswatthama and the&#xA;other great warriors that protected the&#xA;king of Sindhu. They fought fiercely but&#xA;were all defeated and could not prevent&#xA;Arjuna from reaching Jayadratha. The&#xA;attack on Jayadratha began and the battle&#xA;raged long. Both sides were constantly&#xA;looking westwards, for the day was&#xA;nearing its end. The Saindhava was no&#xA;mean foe, and taxed to the full, Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;strength and skill were hard put to it.&#xA;The sun sank towards the horizon and&#xA;reddened, but the battle did not cease.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;There is but a very little time left. It&#xA;seems Jayadratha has been saved and&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s challenge has failed. The vow is&#xA;unfulfilled and Arjuna is going to be&#xA;disgraced,&amp;rdquo; said Duryodhana to himself in&#xA;great glee.&#xA;Then, there was darkness and the cry went&#xA;round in both armies: &amp;ldquo;It is sunset and&#xA;Jayadratha has not been killed. Arjuna has&#xA;lost.&amp;rdquo; The Pandavas were depressed and&#xA;there were shouts of joy in the Kaurava&#xA;army.&#xA;Jayadratha turned to the western horizon&#xA;and thought within himself, &amp;ldquo;I am saved!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;for he did not see the sun then and thought&#xA;the time-limit of danger from Arjuna was&#xA;over.&#xA;At that moment, however, Krishna said to&#xA;Arjuna: &amp;ldquo;Dhananjaya, the Sindhu raja is&#xA;looking at the horizon. I have caused this&#xA;darkness. The sun is still up and has not&#xA;set. Do your work. This is the moment for&#xA;it, for Jayadratha is off his guard.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;A shaft flew from the Gandiva bow, and,&#xA;like a vulture swooping down on a&#xA;chicken, carried away Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s head.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Listen, Arjuna,&amp;rdquo; cried Krishna, &amp;ldquo;send&#xA;your shafts in swift relays, so that the head&#xA;may be supported from falling to the earth&#xA;and borne into Vriddhakshatra&amp;rsquo;s lap.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And Arjuna sent his wonderful arrows&#xA;that carried away the head in the air. It&#xA;was a strange sight. Vriddhakshatra was in&#xA;his ashrama sitting in the open absorbed in&#xA;his evening meditation with eyes closed,&#xA;when his son&amp;rsquo;s head with beautiful black&#xA;hair and golden earrings gently dropped&#xA;into his lap.&#xA;The old king finished his meditation and&#xA;got up, when the head rolled down and&#xA;fell on the ground. And, as ordained,&#xA;Vriddhakshatra&amp;rsquo;s head burst into a&#xA;hundred fragments. Jayadratha and his&#xA;father together reached the abode of the&#xA;brave.&#xA;Kesava, Dhananjaya, Bhima, Satyaki,&#xA;Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas blew their&#xA;conchs and Dharmaraja who heard the&#xA;triumphant noise knew that it meant that&#xA;Arjuna had redeemed his oath and that the&#xA;Saindhava had been slain.&#xA;Then, Yudhishthira led his army fiercely&#xA;against Drona. It was nightfall, but on the&#xA;fourteenth day of the battle the rule of&#xA;cease-fire at sunset was not observed. As&#xA;the passions rose from day to day, one by&#xA;one the rules and restraints broke down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ALL those who have heard the story of&#xA;the&#xA;Mahabharata&#xA;know&#xA;about&#xA;Ghatotkacha, Bhimasena&amp;rsquo;s famous son by&#xA;his asura wife. There are two young men&#xA;among the Mahabharata figures who&#xA;embody all the qualities of heroism,&#xA;fortitude,&#xA;strength,&#xA;courage,&#xA;and&#xA;amiability. They are Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s son,&#xA;Abhimanyu,&#xA;and&#xA;Bhima&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;son,&#xA;Ghatotkacha. Both of them gave up their&#xA;lives on the Kurukshetra battlefield.&#xA;Towards the latter part of the&#xA;Mahabharata fight, the hatred roused onboth sides did not find satisfaction in&#xA;battle conducted during the daytime and&#xA;close at nightfall. On the fourteenth day,&#xA;when the sunset, they did not cease&#xA;fighting but went on with it in torchlight.&#xA;The Kurukshetra field presented a strange&#xA;sight, the like of which had not been seen&#xA;before in Bharatadesa. The generals and&#xA;soldiers on both sides were engaged in&#xA;battle, with thousands of torches burning&#xA;and using signals specially devised for&#xA;nighttime.&#xA;Ghatotkacha and his troops of asuras who&#xA;are strongest at night, found darkness an&#xA;additional&#xA;advantage&#xA;and&#xA;violently&#xA;attacked&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;army.&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s heart sank within him when&#xA;he saw thousands of his men destroyed by&#xA;Ghatotkacha and his demon army moving&#xA;in the air and attacking in weird and&#xA;unexpected ways.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Kill this fellow at once, Karna, for&#xA;otherwise, soon our whole army will cease&#xA;to be. Finish him without further delay.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus begged all the perplexed Kauravas&#xA;of Karna.&#xA;Karna was himself angry and bewildered,&#xA;having just been wounded by one of the&#xA;asura&amp;rsquo;s arrows. He had with him no doubt&#xA;the spear of unerring effect which Indra&#xA;had given to him. But it could be used&#xA;only once, and he had carefully husbanded&#xA;it for exclusive use on Arjuna with whom&#xA;a decisive encounter he knew was&#xA;inevitable.&#xA;But in the confusion and wrath of that&#xA;eerie midnight melee, Karna, impelled by&#xA;a sudden urge, hurled the missile at the&#xA;young giant. Thus was Arjuna saved, but&#xA;at great cost. Bhima&amp;rsquo;s beloved son,&#xA;Ghatotkacha, who from mid-air was&#xA;showering his deadly arrows on the&#xA;Kaurava army, dropped dead, plunging&#xA;the Pandavas in grief.&#xA;The battle did not stop. Drona spread fear&#xA;and destruction in the Pandava army by&#xA;his relentless attacks. &amp;ldquo;O Arjuna,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Krishna, &amp;ldquo;there is none that can defeat this&#xA;Drona, fighting according to the strict&#xA;rules of war. We cannot cope with him&#xA;unless dharma is discarded. We have no&#xA;other way open. There is but one thing&#xA;that will make him desist from fighting. If&#xA;he hears that Aswatthama is dead, Drona&#xA;will lose all interest in life and throw&#xA;down his weapons. Someone must&#xA;therefore tell Drona that Aswatthama has&#xA;been slain.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna shrank in horror at the proposal, as&#xA;he could not bring himself to tell a lie.&#xA;Those who were nearby with him also&#xA;rejected the idea, for no one was minded&#xA;to be a party to deceit.&#xA;Yudhishthira stood for a while reflecting&#xA;deeply. &amp;ldquo;I shall bear the burden of this&#xA;sin,&amp;rdquo; he said and resolved the deadlock!&#xA;It was strange. But when the ocean was&#xA;churned at the beginning of the world and&#xA;the dread poison rose threatening to&#xA;consume the gods, did not Rudra come&#xA;forward to swallow it and save them? To&#xA;save the friend who had wholly depended&#xA;on him, Rama was driven to bear the sin&#xA;of killing Vali, in disregard of the rules of&#xA;fairplay. So also, now did Yudhishthira&#xA;decide to bear the shame of it, for there&#xA;was no other way.&#xA;Bhima lifted his iron mace and brought it&#xA;down on the head of a huge elephant&#xA;called Aswatthama and it fell dead. After&#xA;killing&#xA;the&#xA;elephant&#xA;Aswatthama,&#xA;Bhimasena went near the division&#xA;commanded by Drona and roared so that&#xA;all might hear.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have killed Aswatthama!&amp;rdquo; Bhimasena&#xA;who, until then, had never done or even&#xA;contemplated an ignoble act, was, as he&#xA;uttered these words, greatly ashamed.&#xA;They knocked against his very heart, but&#xA;could they be true? Drona heard these&#xA;words as he was in the act of discharging&#xA;a Brahmastra. &amp;ldquo;Yudhishthira, is it true myson has been slain?&amp;rdquo; Dronacharya asked&#xA;addressing Dharmaputra.&#xA;The acharya thought that Yudhishthira&#xA;would not utter an untruth, even for the&#xA;kingship of the three worlds.&#xA;When Drona asked thus, Krishna was&#xA;terribly perturbed. &amp;ldquo;If Yudhishthira fails&#xA;us now and shrinks from uttering an&#xA;untruth, we are lost. Drona&amp;rsquo;s Brahmastra is&#xA;of unquenchable potency and the&#xA;Pandavas will be destroyed,&amp;rdquo; he said.&#xA;And Yudhishthira himself stood trembling&#xA;in horror of what he was about to do, but&#xA;within him also was the desire to win.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Let it be my sin,&amp;rdquo; he said to himself and&#xA;hardened his heart, and said aloud: &amp;ldquo;Yes,&#xA;it is true that Aswatthama has been&#xA;killed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But, as he was saying it, he felt again the&#xA;disgrace of it and added in a low and&#xA;tremulous&#xA;voice,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Aswatthama,&#xA;the&#xA;elephant&amp;rdquo; words which were however&#xA;drowned in the din and were not heard by&#xA;Drona.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O king, thus was a great sin committed,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Sanjaya to the blind Dhritarashtra,&#xA;while relating the events of the battle to&#xA;him.&#xA;When the words of untruth came out of&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s mouth, the wheels of his&#xA;chariot, which until then always stood and&#xA;moved four inches above the ground and&#xA;never touched it at once came down and&#xA;touched the earth.&#xA;Yudhishthira, who till then had stood&#xA;apart from the world so full of untruth,&#xA;suddenly became of the earth, earthy. He&#xA;too desired victory and slipped into the&#xA;way of untruth and so his chariot came&#xA;down to the common road of mankind.&#xA;When Drona heard that his beloved son&#xA;had been slain, all his attachment to life&#xA;snapped. And desire vanished as if it had&#xA;never been there. When the veteran was in&#xA;that mood, Bhimasena loudly spoke&#xA;indicting him in harsh words:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You&#xA;brahmanas,&#xA;abandoning&#xA;the&#xA;legitimate functions of your varna and&#xA;taking to the Kshatriya profession of arms,&#xA;have brought ruin to princes. If you&#xA;brahmanas had not gone astray from the&#xA;duties belonging to you by birth, the&#xA;princes would not have been led to this&#xA;destruction. You teach that non-killing is&#xA;the highest dharma and that the brahmana&#xA;is the supporter and nourisher of that&#xA;dharma. Yet, you have rejected that&#xA;wisdom which is yours by birth, and&#xA;shamelessly undertaken the profession of&#xA;killing. It was our misfortune that you&#xA;descended to this sinful life.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;These taunts of Bhimasena caused&#xA;excruciating pain to Drona who had&#xA;already lost the will to live. He threw his&#xA;weapons away and sat down in yoga on&#xA;the floor of his chariot and was soon in a&#xA;trance.&#xA;At this moment Dhrishtadyumna with&#xA;drawn sword, came and climbed in to the&#xA;chariot and heedless of cries of horror and&#xA;deprecation from all around he fulfilled&#xA;his destiny as the slayer of Drona by&#xA;sweeping off the old warrior&amp;rsquo;s head. And&#xA;the soul of the son of Bharadwaja issued&#xA;out in a visible blaze of fight and mounted&#xA;heavenwards.&#xA;The Mahabharata is a great and wonderful&#xA;story. The sorrows of human life are&#xA;painted with sublime beauty and rolled&#xA;out in a grand panorama. Behind the story&#xA;of errors and sorrows the poet enables us&#xA;to have a vision of the Transcendent&#xA;Reality. Thus it is that the Mahabharata,&#xA;though a story, has come to be a book of&#xA;dharma. This book, in style and substance,&#xA;is altogether different from tales and&#xA;romances. In modern novels, dramas and&#xA;pictures, exciting scenes are enacted, the&#xA;hero passes through dangers and&#xA;difficulties and finally marries a woman&#xA;whom he loves. Or else everything seems&#xA;to go on happily but suddenly things gowrong and terrible misfortune happens&#xA;and the curtain drops. This is the art&#xA;scheme of ordinary sensational stories.&#xA;The Ramayana and the Mahabharata are&#xA;quite a different kind of artistic creation.&#xA;When we read them, our inner being is&#xA;seized and cleansed, so to say, by being&#xA;passed alternately through joys and&#xA;sorrows, and we are finally lifted above&#xA;both and taken to the Transcendent and&#xA;Real.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN Drona died, the princes of the&#xA;Kaurava army installed Karna as&#xA;Generalissimo. Karna stood up in his&#xA;gorgeous war chariot driven by Salya. The&#xA;dauntless confidence of his bearing and&#xA;his great renown as a warrior heartened&#xA;the Kauravas. The battle again began.&#xA;Readers of the stars were consulted and&#xA;the Pandavas chose the propitious hour for&#xA;grim battle. Arjuna led the attack on&#xA;Karna,&#xA;supported&#xA;by&#xA;Bhimasena&#xA;immediately behind his chariot.&#xA;Duhsasana made a concentrated attack on&#xA;Bhima and sent a shower of arrows at&#xA;him. Bhima chuckled and said to himself.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have this wretch now safe in my hands.&#xA;I shall today redeem my promise to&#xA;Draupadi. Too long has my oath waited&#xA;for performance.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As Bhima thus bethought himself of what&#xA;Duhsasana had done to Draupadi, the&#xA;anger within him blazed up uncontrollably&#xA;and throwing down all his weapons, he&#xA;jumped from his chariot and leapt upon&#xA;Duhsasana like a tiger on its prey, hurled&#xA;him down and broke his limbs.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Wicked beast, is this the wretched hand&#xA;that held Draupadi by the hair? Here, I&#xA;tear out the root from your body. If there&#xA;be any here wishing to help you, let him&#xA;come forward and try!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Glaring hatefully at Duryodhana as he&#xA;roared this challenge, Bhimasena tore&#xA;Duhsasana&amp;rsquo;s arm out and threw the&#xA;bleeding limb on the battlefield.&#xA;And then he fulfilled the terrible oath he&#xA;had taken thirteen years before. He sucked&#xA;and drank the blood from his enemy&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;body like a beast of prey and danced on&#xA;the bloody field, mad with passion. &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;have done it!&amp;rdquo; he roared. &amp;ldquo;The oath I&#xA;swore against this great sinner has been&#xA;redeemed. It only remains to redeem my&#xA;oath as regards Duryodhana. The&#xA;sacrificial fire is ready. Let that victim&#xA;also prepare.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The scene made everyone shudder. Even&#xA;great Karna was shaken as he saw Bhima&#xA;in this ecstasy of wrath. &amp;ldquo;Do not flinch,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Salya to Karna. &amp;ldquo;It does not befit you&#xA;to show any sign that may be mistaken for&#xA;fear. When Duryodhana stands quivering&#xA;in despair; it is not right that you also&#xA;should lose heart. After the great&#xA;Duhsasana&amp;rsquo;s death, the army&amp;rsquo;s hope rests&#xA;solely on you. You must now bear the full&#xA;burden. Like the gallant warrior you are,&#xA;seek single combat with Arjuna, and win&#xA;eternal glory on earth or the soldier&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;heaven!&amp;rdquo; At these words, Karna recovered&#xA;his courageous spirit. With eyes red with&#xA;wrath and unshed tears, he bade Salya&#xA;drive the chariot towards Arjuna.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Enough of fighting,&amp;rdquo; said Aswatthama&#xA;addressing Duryodhana earnestly. &amp;ldquo;Let us&#xA;terminate this disastrous enmity. Beloved&#xA;friend, make peace with the Pandavas.&#xA;Stop the battle.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What? Did you not hear the words that&#xA;the stubborn Bhima uttered when like a&#xA;ravening beast, he drank human blood and&#xA;danced over my brother&amp;rsquo;s mangled body?&#xA;What talk can there be now of peace?&#xA;Why do you speak vain words!&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Duryodhana. Saying thus, he ordered a&#xA;fresh disposition of the forces, and gave&#xA;the command for attack.&#xA;Then followed a great battle. The son of&#xA;Surya sent a dazzling arrow, which spatfire and made for Arjuna, like a serpent&#xA;with its flaming double-tongue out. Then&#xA;Krishna, Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s charioteer, at the nick of&#xA;time, pressed the vehicle down five&#xA;fingers deep in the mud, so that the&#xA;serpent shaft just missed Partha&amp;rsquo;s head but&#xA;struck off his helmet! Arjuna was red with&#xA;shame and anger and he fixed a dart on his&#xA;bow to make an end of Karna.&#xA;And Karna&amp;rsquo;s fated hour was come, and as&#xA;had been foretold, the left wheel of his&#xA;chariot suddenly sank in the bloody mire.&#xA;He jumped down on the ground to lift the&#xA;wheel up from the mud.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Wait a minute!&amp;rdquo; he cried. &amp;ldquo;My chariot&#xA;has sunk in the ground. Great warrior as&#xA;you are, and knowing dharma as you do,&#xA;you would certainly not take unfair&#xA;advantage of this accident. I shall&#xA;presently set my car right and give you all&#xA;the battle you want.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna hesitated. Karna was now&#xA;somewhat perturbed on account of the&#xA;mishap. He remembered the curse that had&#xA;been pronounced on him, and again&#xA;appealed to Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s sense of honor.&#xA;Krishna intervened. &amp;ldquo;Ha, Karna!&amp;rdquo; be&#xA;exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;it is well that you too&#xA;remember that there are things like&#xA;fairplay and chivalry! Now that you are in&#xA;difficulty, you remember them indeed.&#xA;But when you and Duryodhana and&#xA;Duhsasana and Sakuni dragged Draupadi&#xA;to the Hall of Assembly and insulted her,&#xA;how was it you forgot them utterly? You&#xA;helped to inveigle Dharmaputra, who was&#xA;fond of play but was unskilled at it, to&#xA;gamble, and you cheated him. Where had&#xA;your fairplay hidden itself then? Was it&#xA;fairplay to refuse to give to Yudhishthira&#xA;his kingdom when according to the pledge&#xA;the twelve years of forest life and the&#xA;thirteenth year incognito were duly&#xA;completed? What had happened to the&#xA;dharma you appeal for now? You&#xA;conspired with the wicked men who&#xA;sought to poison and kill Bhima. You&#xA;acquiesced in the plot to burn the&#xA;Pandavas alive when sleeping in the&#xA;palace of wax into which they had been&#xA;lured. What had happened to dharma all&#xA;that time? What did dharma tell you when&#xA;violent hands were laid on Draupadi and&#xA;you were looking on enjoying the sight?&#xA;Did you not then mock at her saying:&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Your husbands have left you unprotected,&#xA;go and marry another husband&amp;rsquo;? The&#xA;tongue that was not ashamed to utter those&#xA;words now talks of chivalry. Chivalry&#xA;indeed! When a mob of you surrounded&#xA;the young Abhimanyu and shamelessly&#xA;slew him, was that chivalry? Wicked man,&#xA;do not talk now of chivalry and fairplay,&#xA;for you have never honored them!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Krishna was denouncing him in this&#xA;manner in order to urge Arjuna to prompt&#xA;action, Karna bent his head in shame and&#xA;uttered not a word. Karna silently&#xA;ascended the chariot leaving the wheel&#xA;still stuck in the mud and took his bow&#xA;and sent an arrow at Arjuna with unerring&#xA;aim and such power that it stunned him&#xA;for a moment.&#xA;Karna utilised the respite won, to jump&#xA;down again and hurriedly tried to lift the&#xA;chariot wheel up. But the curse was too&#xA;strong for him and fortune had deserted&#xA;the great warrior.&#xA;The wheel would not budge, though he&#xA;strove with all his great strength. Then he&#xA;tried to recall the mantras of mighty astras&#xA;he had learnt from Parasurama, but his&#xA;memory failed in the hour of his need,&#xA;even as Parasurama had foretold.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Waste no more time, Arjuna,&amp;rdquo; cried&#xA;Madhava. &amp;ldquo;Send your shaft and slay your&#xA;wicked enemy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s mind was wavering. His hand&#xA;hesitated to do what was not chivalrous.&#xA;But when Krishna said this, the poet says:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Arjuna accepted this command of theLord and sent an arrow which cut and&#xA;severed the head of the Radheya.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The poet had not the heart to impute this&#xA;act to Arjuna who was the embodiment of&#xA;nobility. It was the Lord Krishna that&#xA;incited Arjuna to kill Karna when he was&#xA;vainly trying to raise his chariot out of the&#xA;mud in which it had stuck. According to&#xA;the code of honor and laws of war&#xA;prevailing then, it was wholly wrong.&#xA;Who could bear the responsibility for&#xA;breaches of dharma except the Lord&#xA;Himself? The lesson is that it is vanity to&#xA;hope, through physical violence and war,&#xA;to put down wrong. The battle for right,&#xA;conducted through physical force leads to&#xA;numerous wrongs and, in the net result,&#xA;adharma increases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN Duryodhana beheld Karna&amp;rsquo;s death,&#xA;his grief knew no bounds. Kripacharya&#xA;was deeply moved by Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;anguish of heart and said: &amp;ldquo;Moved by&#xA;ambition and greed we placed too great a&#xA;burden&#xA;on&#xA;friends.&#xA;They&#xA;have&#xA;uncomplainingly borne it and laid down&#xA;their lives on the battlefield and attained&#xA;the happy regions above. There is but one&#xA;course left to you to make peace with the&#xA;Pandavas. Do not, O King, any longer&#xA;continue this ruinous fight.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Even at that moment of deep despair,&#xA;Duryodhana did not relish this counsel.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Perhaps, there was a time for that, but it&#xA;is long past. What talk can there be of&#xA;peace between the Pandavas and us with&#xA;all this inexpiable blood between us, the&#xA;blood of our dearest and theirs? If I&#xA;surrender in order to escape death, how&#xA;can I escape the contempt of the world?&#xA;What happiness can I hope to have in a&#xA;life so ignobly saved? And what joy can I&#xA;hope to find in sovereignty, secured by a&#xA;peace after my brothers and relatives have&#xA;all been slain?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;These words of Duryodhana were lustily&#xA;cheered by the others. They supported his&#xA;stand and they chose Salya and gave him&#xA;the supreme command from then on.&#xA;Salya was mighty of limb and as brave as&#xA;any of the warriors who had been killed.&#xA;The army was arrayed under his&#xA;leadership and the battle raged fiercely.&#xA;On the side of the Pandavas, Yudhishthira&#xA;now led the attack personally against&#xA;Salya. It astonished everyone to see how&#xA;the man, who was till then the very&#xA;incarnation of gentle ness, fought so&#xA;furiously.&#xA;The battle was equal for a long while,&#xA;when Yudhishthira hurled at Salya, his&#xA;spear that went straight and struck him.&#xA;Like the great flagstaff at the end of a&#xA;festive function, Salya&amp;rsquo;s body lay lifeless&#xA;on the field, crimson with blood.&#xA;When Salya, the last of the great generals,&#xA;fell dead, the Kaurava army lost all hope.&#xA;The surviving sons of Dhritarashtra,&#xA;however, joined together and attacked&#xA;Bhima from all sides. He slew them all.&#xA;The son of Vayu had nourished his&#xA;burning anger for thirteen years from the&#xA;time Draupadi was insulted in the Hall of&#xA;Assembly. He said to himself now: &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;have not lived in vain, but Duryodhana&#xA;still lives,&amp;rdquo; and smiled grimly.&#xA;Sakuni led the attack on Sahadeva&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;division. After a while, Sahadeva&#xA;discharged a sharp-edged sword-arrow&#xA;saying: &amp;ldquo;Fool, here is the reward for your&#xA;great sin.&amp;rdquo; It went straight and cut through&#xA;Sakuni&amp;rsquo;s neck like a sword. And the head,&#xA;which was at the root of all the wicked&#xA;deeds of the Kauravas, rolled on the&#xA;ground.&#xA;Left leaderless, the wreck of the broken&#xA;army scattered and fled in all directions,&#xA;pursued and slaughtered to a man by the&#xA;exulting victors.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Thus utterly was destroyed thine army of&#xA;eleven Akshauhinis, O! Bharata, out ofthe thousands of kings, who espoused thy&#xA;cause in their pride and might, only&#xA;Duryodhana could be seen on that&#xA;battlefield, fainting and sore wounded,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Sanjaya, describing the debacle to the&#xA;blind king.&#xA;After doing, in vain, all he could to rally&#xA;his defeated army, Duryodhana, left&#xA;almost alone, took up his mace and&#xA;walked towards a pool of water. His&#xA;whole frame was burning like fire, and&#xA;water attracted him. &amp;ldquo;The wise Vidura&#xA;knew what would happen and he told us,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he said to himself, as he entered the water.&#xA;Of what avail is wisdom that comes too&#xA;late? What has been done must produce its&#xA;result that has to be suffered. That is the&#xA;law. Yudhishthira and his brothers arrived&#xA;there in relentless, pursuit of their great&#xA;enemy.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Duryodhana!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Yudhishthira,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;after destroying family and tribe, would&#xA;you yourself escape death by concealing&#xA;yourself in this pond? Where is your pride&#xA;now? Have you no shame? Come up and&#xA;fight. A kshatriya by birth, do you shrink&#xA;battle and death?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Stung to the quick by these words,&#xA;Duryodhana replied with dignity: &amp;ldquo;I have&#xA;not come here, Dharmaputra, a fugitive&#xA;for my life. It was not fear that brought&#xA;me here. I stepped into the water to cool&#xA;the fire that is raging within me. I neither&#xA;fear death nor wish to live, but why&#xA;should I fight? The earth has now nothing&#xA;left that I came to fight for! All those who&#xA;stood by me have been slain. My desire&#xA;for kingdom is gone. I leave the world to&#xA;you without a rival. Enjoy it in undisputed&#xA;sovereignty.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Now, that is really&#xA;generous, especially after you said you&#xA;would not allow us even a needle-point of&#xA;land. When we begged for peace and&#xA;entreated you to give us a portion, you&#xA;spurned our proposal. Now, you say we&#xA;may take it all. It is not for kingdom or&#xA;land that we fight. Must I recount all your&#xA;sins? The wrongs you did us, and the&#xA;outrage you perpetrated on Draupadi,&#xA;cannot be expiated except with your life.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sanjaya, who related the events to the&#xA;blind old king, here said: &amp;ldquo;When your son&#xA;Duryodhana heard these harsh and cruel&#xA;words spoken by Dharmaputra, he at once&#xA;rose from the water, mace in hand.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Stepping out of the pool, the unfortunate&#xA;Duryodhana said: &amp;ldquo;Come, one by one, all&#xA;of you, for I am single. You five will&#xA;surely not join together and attack me who&#xA;am alone and without armor, weary and&#xA;wounded all over.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira replied sharply: &amp;ldquo;If indeed it&#xA;be wrong for many to join together and&#xA;attack a single person, pray tell us how&#xA;Abhimanyu was attacked and killed? Did&#xA;you not consent to many combining and&#xA;attacking that boy, standing all alone&#xA;amidst your crowd? Yes, when men face&#xA;misfortune, they see and preach dharma&#xA;and chivalry to others. Wear your coat of&#xA;armor. Choose any of us you like and&#xA;fight. Die and go to swarga or win and be&#xA;king.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accordingly, the combat began between&#xA;Bhima and Duryodhana. Sparks of fire&#xA;flew&#xA;when&#xA;their&#xA;maces&#xA;clashed.&#xA;Duryodhana and Bhima were equal in&#xA;strength and skill, and the battle raged&#xA;long, and the issue hung doubtful. Those,&#xA;who stood watching, were debating as to&#xA;whom would win. Krishna said to Arjuna&#xA;that Bhima would redeem the oath he&#xA;swore in the Hall of Assembly and smash&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s thighs. Bhima heard this&#xA;and, at that moment, the memory of the&#xA;great outrage came vividly to his mind.&#xA;He leaped like a lion and came down with&#xA;his mace on Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s thighs and&#xA;broke them and Duryodhana fell heavily&#xA;on the ground, wounded to death.Bhima jumped on the prostrate body of&#xA;his enemy, stamped on his head with his&#xA;heavy foot and danced a terrible dance.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Cease, Bhima,&amp;rdquo; cried Dharmaraja. &amp;ldquo;You&#xA;have paid off the debt. Duryodhana is a&#xA;prince and a cousin. It is not right to put&#xA;your foot on his head.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Said Krishna:&amp;ldquo;Soon the wicked man&amp;rsquo;s soul&#xA;will depart from the body. Sons of Pandu,&#xA;Duryodhana and his friends have been&#xA;slain. Why linger here? On to your&#xA;chariots.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Krishna said this, the face of the&#xA;fallen Duryodhana glowed like a blazing&#xA;fire with anger and hatred. Turning his&#xA;eyes towards Krishna be said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;By base tricks you contrived the death of&#xA;warriors, who fought bravely according to&#xA;the laws of war. You could not have&#xA;dreamt of victory in a fair fight with&#xA;Karna or Bhishma or Drona. Have you not&#xA;a spark of shame left?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Even dying, Duryodhana felt no regret for&#xA;all that he had done.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Duryodhana,&amp;rdquo; said Krishna, &amp;ldquo;vainly do&#xA;you accuse others. Greed and pride of&#xA;power led you to unnumbered wicked&#xA;deeds and you are reaping as you sowed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Wretch!&amp;rdquo; replied Duryodhana. &amp;ldquo;Living, I&#xA;was a great prince, generous friend, and a&#xA;terrible foe. All human joys, such joys as&#xA;kings wish for in vain, and even Gods do&#xA;not despise, have been mine, in their&#xA;fullness. A warrior&amp;rsquo;s death is the fitting&#xA;crown of such a life. Dying, I go&#xA;triumphantly to swarga to join my friends&#xA;and my brothers who have gone there&#xA;already and are waiting to welcome me.&#xA;You remain here below, your objects&#xA;defeated and yourselves the object of&#xA;contempt of all kshatriyas. I do not mind&#xA;Bhima putting his foot on my head as I lie&#xA;helpless on the ground with legs broken.&#xA;What care I? In a few minutes more will&#xA;not the feet of crows and vultures settle on&#xA;my head?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Duryodhana said this, flowers were&#xA;showered down from the heavens by the&#xA;gods. Inordinate desire took Duryodhana&#xA;into the wrong path, whence ensued anger&#xA;and numerous breaches of dharma. But no&#xA;one could question the unconquerable&#xA;spirit of Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s son.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN the war was nearing its end,&#xA;Balarama arrived at Kurukshetra after&#xA;completing his tour of holy places. He&#xA;came just when Bhima and Duryodhana&#xA;were engaged in their last mortal combat.&#xA;He saw Bhima aiming the deadly blow&#xA;which broke Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s thighs, and his&#xA;anger flamed up at this great breach of the&#xA;rules of single combat.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Fie upon you all! Would any kshatriya&#xA;hit below the navel? This Bhima has&#xA;offended the law most disgracefully,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;exclaimed and impatiently going up to his&#xA;brother Krishna, shouted:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You can look on and tolerate all this. But&#xA;I cannot bear to see such unclean&#xA;fighting!&amp;rdquo; Saying this he advanced&#xA;towards the offending Bhima with&#xA;upraised plough. The plough was&#xA;Balarama&amp;rsquo;s weapon on supreme occasions,&#xA;as the discus was Krishna&amp;rsquo;s. Krishna was&#xA;alarmed when he saw his elder brother&#xA;advancing in a passion towards Bhima.&#xA;He rushed forward and, intercepting him,&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;The Pandavas are our friends and&#xA;closest relations. They have been the&#xA;victims of insufferable wrongs at the&#xA;hands of Duryodhana. When Draupadi&#xA;was insulted in the Assembly Hall, Bhima&#xA;vowed: &amp;lsquo;I will one day in battle break the&#xA;two thighs of Duryodhana with this mace&#xA;and kill him.&amp;rsquo; He proclaimed this solemn&#xA;oath at that time and everyone has known&#xA;it. It is the duty of a kshatriya to fulfil the&#xA;vow he has solemnly taken. Do not let&#xA;your anger mislead you and do not be&#xA;unjust to the innocent Pandavas. You&#xA;should, before condemning Bhima, takeinto account all the wrongs that the&#xA;Kauravas have done to the Pandavas.&#xA;Nothing but error can result if one&#xA;proceeds to judge conduct without taking&#xA;into account the chain of events leading&#xA;up to it. You cannot snatch a particular act&#xA;out of its context and proceed to give&#xA;judgment on it alone without gross&#xA;injustice. The era of Kali has arrived,&#xA;when the laws of a previous age cannot&#xA;apply. It was not wrong for Bhima to&#xA;strike below the navel an enemy who had&#xA;wickedly contrived against his life on&#xA;many occasions. It was because of&#xA;Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s foul instigation that Karna&#xA;sent a shaft from behind and broke&#xA;Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s bowstring when he was&#xA;defending himself against heavy odds.&#xA;Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s young son was attacked by&#xA;numerous warriors who surrounded him,&#xA;when he stood all by himself in the field,&#xA;deprived of bow and chariot, and in a&#xA;most cowardly manner, killed him.&#xA;Duryodhana thought evil and practised&#xA;deception from the time of his birth and&#xA;has brought about the destruction of his&#xA;people. There is no sin in Bhima killing&#xA;this man. Bhima bore the wrongs done&#xA;and kept his wrath within himself for&#xA;thirteen long years. Duryodhana knew&#xA;well that Bhima had sworn to break his&#xA;thighs and kill him. When he challenged&#xA;the aggrieved Pandavas to battle, he knew&#xA;very well that he invited Bhima to make&#xA;good his oath. How can you think that it&#xA;was wrong for Bhima to do this?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Krishna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;words&#xA;did&#xA;not&#xA;change&#xA;Balarama&amp;rsquo;s opinion, but his anger&#xA;subsided. &amp;ldquo;Duryodhana will attain the&#xA;happy regions reserved for the brave.&#xA;Bhima&amp;rsquo;s fame has been tarnished for all&#xA;time. It will be said among men that the&#xA;son of Pandu broke the laws of war in&#xA;attacking Duryodhana. It will remain&#xA;forever a great blot on his good name. I&#xA;hate to stay here any longer.&amp;rdquo; So saying&#xA;the indignant Balarama immediately left&#xA;for Dwaraka.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yudhishthira, why this strange silence?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;asked Krishna.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Madhava, it hurts me to see Bhima&#xA;leap on cousin Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s mortally&#xA;wounded body and trample on his head. I&#xA;see the end of the glory of our race. We&#xA;were wronged by the Kauravas. I know&#xA;the full measure of grief and anger in&#xA;Vrikodara&amp;rsquo;s heart, and don&amp;rsquo;t wish to blame&#xA;him beyond reason. We have killed&#xA;Duryodhana, who was afflicted by&#xA;uncontained greed and poverty of&#xA;understanding. What serves it now to&#xA;debate the ethics of it or nicely to weigh&#xA;the propriety of a much wronged man&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;revenges?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira was greatly oppressed in&#xA;mind. When men transgress the law,&#xA;extenuations and excuses are of no avail&#xA;in giving mental satisfaction.&#xA;Arjuna, of penetrating intellect, was silent.&#xA;He did not show approval of Bhima&amp;rsquo;s act.&#xA;Nor did he say anything by way of&#xA;detraction. The rest of the people, who&#xA;were there, were however loud in&#xA;condemnation of Duryodhana and were&#xA;reminding one another of all his misdeeds&#xA;and errors. Krishna turned towards them&#xA;and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Warriors, it is not proper that we go on&#xA;speaking against an enemy who has been&#xA;defeated and is lying mortally wounded.&#xA;We should not speak ill of a dying man.&#xA;He was stupid and brought about his own&#xA;end. He fell into the company of bad men&#xA;and was ruined. Let us go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Duryodhana, who was stretched on the&#xA;ground in intense, agony, when he heard&#xA;Krishna say this, went into a paroxysm of&#xA;rage. He half raised himself on his arms in&#xA;spite of the excruciating pain, and&#xA;exclaimed:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Wretch! Son of a slave! Was not your&#xA;father Vasudeva Kamsa&amp;rsquo;s slave? You haveno business to sit or move with princes.&#xA;You speak like a shameless wretch. I saw&#xA;you instigate Bhima to aim his blow at my&#xA;thigh! Do you think I did not see you,&#xA;making as though casually talking to&#xA;Arjuna, pointing to your thigh, but really&#xA;indicating to Bhima that he should strike&#xA;me on the thighs, disregarding the laws of&#xA;single combat? Till then it had been equal&#xA;battle. You have neither pity nor shame.&#xA;Did you not contrive the death of the&#xA;grandsire Bhishma through stratagem?&#xA;You advised Sikhandin to be placed in&#xA;front when attacking Bhishma, knowing&#xA;that the grandsire would scorn to fight a&#xA;woman, and would let himself be mortally&#xA;wounded without resistance. You brought&#xA;about the end of Dronacharya through&#xA;making Dharmaputra utter a falsehood.&#xA;You were the father of that deadly lie that&#xA;issued from Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s mouth, and&#xA;made Dronacharya throw his bow away.&#xA;Did you not look on without protest, and&#xA;rejoice,&#xA;when&#xA;that,&#xA;wretch&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna attacked and killed the&#xA;acharya who had stopped fighting,&#xA;throwing away his weapons, and settled&#xA;down in yoga posture for meditation on&#xA;the Supreme? Was it not you who&#xA;wickedly contrived to make Karna hurl&#xA;the fatal spear at Ghatotkacha instead of&#xA;reserving it for Arjuna as he had all along&#xA;resolved to do? O great sinner, surely it&#xA;was you who instigated Satyaki to butcher&#xA;Bhurisravas when his right arm had been&#xA;foully cut off and he stopped fighting and&#xA;spread his arrows for a seat for holy&#xA;meditation. It was you who brought about&#xA;the death of Karna by inducing Arjuna to&#xA;attack him in a cowardly manner when he&#xA;was engaged in lifting his chariot wheel&#xA;which had sunk and stuck in the mud in&#xA;the field of battle. Oh worthless man, sole&#xA;cause of our destruction, the whole world&#xA;has condemned your act when by sorcery&#xA;you made it appear as if the sun had set.&#xA;You made Jayadratha, the Sindhu king,&#xA;believe that the day was over and he was&#xA;past danger, and thus he was slain when&#xA;he was off his guard.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus&#xA;did&#xA;Duryodhana&#xA;pour&#xA;his&#xA;denunciation against Krishna and then,&#xA;exhausted by the pain of his wounds and&#xA;the violence of his rage, he fell prostrate&#xA;again.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Son of Gandhari,&amp;rdquo; said Krishna, &amp;ldquo;why do&#xA;you let your anger add to the pain of your&#xA;last moments? It is your own misdeeds&#xA;that have brought about your end. Do not&#xA;attribute it to me. Bhishma and Drona had&#xA;to die on account of your sins. So also&#xA;were you the cause of the death of Karna&#xA;and others. Need I recount all the wrongs&#xA;that you were guilty of against the sons of&#xA;Pandu? What punishment can be too&#xA;severe for the great outrage, which you&#xA;inflicted on Draupadi? The animosities&#xA;and passions that resulted from your&#xA;misdeeds cannot be made ground for&#xA;condemning others. All the deceptions&#xA;and lapses you charge us with were forced&#xA;on us by reason of your wicked conduct.&#xA;You have paid off on the battlefield the&#xA;debt incurred by your greed. But you are&#xA;dying the death of a brave man. You will&#xA;go to the happy regions reserved for&#xA;kshatriyas who lay down their lives on the&#xA;field of battle.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Krishna, I go to swarga with my friends&#xA;and relatives. But you and your friends&#xA;will live on earth to suffer,&amp;rdquo; said the&#xA;stubborn Duryodhana. &amp;ldquo;I studied the&#xA;Vedas. I have given gifts ordained by law&#xA;and I have reigned supreme over all the&#xA;sea-girt earth. While I lived, I stood upon&#xA;the humbled heads of foes. All human&#xA;joys, such joys as even the Gods cannot&#xA;despise and kings sigh for in vain, the&#xA;very pinnacle of power, were mine. Dying&#xA;now, such death as warriors deem the&#xA;crown of kshatriya life, I go to meet in&#xA;heaven my friends and brothers gonebefore, eager to welcome me. Who is&#xA;more blest, I, or you who, doomed to&#xA;linger here, mourning for slaughtered&#xA;friends in desolate homes, find the long&#xA;sought triumph but ashes in your mouth?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Duryodhana. And the gods showered&#xA;flowers down on the dying warrior and the&#xA;gandharvas played music and the sky was&#xA;illuminated. Vasudeva and the Pandavas&#xA;felt small.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;There is truth,&amp;rdquo; said Krishna, &amp;ldquo;in what&#xA;Duryodhana said. You could not have&#xA;defeated him by fair means. This wicked&#xA;man was invincible in battle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN&#xA;Aswatthama&#xA;heard&#xA;how&#xA;Duryodhana lay mortally injured, and&#xA;learnt the details of the combat, his&#xA;righteous anger swelled like the sea. The&#xA;deception, practised by the Pandavas in&#xA;order to bring about his father&amp;rsquo;s end, had&#xA;been rankling in his mind.&#xA;Now, when he learnt how Duryodhana&#xA;had been stricken down mortally against&#xA;all rules of chivalry, he went to the spot&#xA;where Duryodhana was lying and there&#xA;took an oath that he would that night send&#xA;the Pandavas to the abode of Yama.&#xA;Duryodhana, who was in the last physical&#xA;agony of departing life, was transported&#xA;with joy when he heard Aswatthama take&#xA;this oath. He immediately ordered those&#xA;who stood nearby to install Aswatthama&#xA;as Supreme Commander of the Army with&#xA;due ceremony and, when that was over,&#xA;said to Him: &amp;ldquo;All my hopes are in you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It was sunset and the forest was in utter&#xA;darkness when under a big banian tree&#xA;Kripacharya, Kritavarma and Aswatthama&#xA;halted for rest. They were so greatly&#xA;fatigued that Kripacharya and Kritavarma&#xA;fell fast asleep as soon as they lay down.&#xA;But Aswatthama did not get sleep, for&#xA;sorrow, indignation and hatred burnt&#xA;within him. He was listening to the noises&#xA;that the nocturnal birds and prowling&#xA;beasts began to make as the night&#xA;advanced. He was turning over in his&#xA;mind how to execute his promise to&#xA;Duryodhana.&#xA;On the branches of the banian tree, under&#xA;which the three warriors were resting,&#xA;hundreds of crows roosted. They were all&#xA;quiet and asleep until a big owl came and&#xA;began to attack the birds one after another&#xA;and kill them. When Aswatthama saw the&#xA;nocturnal bird of prey tear the helpless&#xA;crows, he got an idea. The crows that&#xA;could not see at night flew round and&#xA;round helplessly and fell victims to the&#xA;owl that attacked them violently.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;These wicked Pandavas and the Panchala&#xA;that killed my father and all their&#xA;supporters can easily be killed by us, if we&#xA;surprise them when they are sleeping in&#xA;their tents at night even as this owl is&#xA;attacking these blind crows. Thus can I&#xA;avenge the deeds of foul play they have&#xA;practised on us. I am deeply indebted to&#xA;this bird of prey from whom I have&#xA;received the teaching. There is no offence&#xA;in adopting plans to suit one&amp;rsquo;s altered&#xA;circumstances. If we can lawfully attack&#xA;an enemy, when his army is tired or when&#xA;his forces are scattered, why then should&#xA;not we, who have lost our armies, attack&#xA;our enemies when they are asleep? There&#xA;can be nothing wrong in it. Indeed it is&#xA;only thus that we can punish and defeat&#xA;these Pandavas who have achieved&#xA;successes through foul play. We have no&#xA;other course open.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Aswatthama made up his mind and he&#xA;immediately woke up Kripacharya and&#xA;informed him of his plan. Kripacharya,&#xA;who heard it, was astonished.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This can never be,&amp;rdquo; said he. &amp;ldquo;It is wholly&#xA;wrong. To attack men who have retired to&#xA;sleep, has never been done before. It&#xA;would be an unprecedented crime against&#xA;the&#xA;laws&#xA;of&#xA;kshatriya&#xA;conduct.&#xA;Aswatthama, for whom are we fighting?The man for whose sake we joined in this&#xA;war has been fatally wounded and his end&#xA;has arrived. We have discharged our&#xA;obligations most loyally. We fought our&#xA;best for the greedy and wrongheaded&#xA;Duryodhana but we failed irretrievably.&#xA;There is no purpose now in our continuing&#xA;the fight and it is folly to do so. Let us go&#xA;to Dhritarashtra and the faultless&#xA;Gandhari, and place ourselves at their&#xA;disposal. Let us take counsel of wise&#xA;Vidura also. They will tell us what lies&#xA;before us to do.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When&#xA;Kripacharya&#xA;spoke&#xA;thus,&#xA;Aswatthama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;grief&#xA;and&#xA;indignation&#xA;increased and he spoke bitterly:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Everyone feels sure that what he thinks is&#xA;the only right and proper thing to do.&#xA;One&amp;rsquo;s understanding naturally limits one&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;vision. These Pandavas have been guilty&#xA;of the foulest conduct. They killed my&#xA;noble and trustful father through a lie.&#xA;They have killed Duryodhana against the&#xA;laws of chivalry. I have no doubt in my&#xA;mind that what I propose to do is quite&#xA;proper vengeance for all these foul deeds.&#xA;It is only if I carry out this plan that I can&#xA;possibly repay my debt to my king and to&#xA;my father. I have decided on it and I do&#xA;not propose to alter my plan. I am going&#xA;tonight to the tents where they are&#xA;sleeping having cast off their armor and&#xA;there I will kill the Pandavas and&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna while they are asleep.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kripacharya was deeply grieved to hear&#xA;Aswatthama speak thus: &amp;ldquo;You have&#xA;attained a great name among men,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;pleaded, &amp;ldquo;Your spotless character will by&#xA;this be blemished, even like a milk-white&#xA;cloth bespattered with blood. Never could&#xA;it be right to kill sleeping men. Desist&#xA;from this.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sir, what are you talking? These&#xA;Pandavas butchered my father when he&#xA;had thrown away all his weapons and had&#xA;sat down in prayer. These men have&#xA;breached the embankment of dharma and&#xA;released the flood, and not a, drop of&#xA;dharma is now left! Karna, who was on&#xA;the ground putting right the wheel of his&#xA;chariot, was murdered by these lawless&#xA;rascals. Bhima has killed Duryodhana&#xA;with a blow below the navel. What&#xA;dharma has been left for us to follow? The&#xA;Pandavas have, once for all, destroyed the&#xA;wall of dharma. Why should we make&#xA;research into law and chivalry when&#xA;dealing with these ruffians who have&#xA;attained successes by destroying both? If&#xA;by killing the sleeping Panchalas, who&#xA;butchered my great father, I may be&#xA;doomed to rebirth in the body of a foul&#xA;bird or of a wriggling worm, I do not care.&#xA;I seek such a birth!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying this and, without waiting for an&#xA;answer, Aswatthama proceeded to harness&#xA;his horses and get his chariot ready to&#xA;start. When he was about to leave&#xA;Kripacharya and Kritavarma cried: &amp;ldquo;Stop.&#xA;What are you resolved upon doing,&#xA;Aswatthama? We cannot approve of it,&#xA;but neither can we desert you in your&#xA;desperate enterprise. The path you are&#xA;bent on treading, we shall also follow. The&#xA;sin you are resolved upon, let us share&#xA;also.&amp;rdquo; So, they went along with him. Thus&#xA;does evil grow! One transgression begets&#xA;the next and thus evil grows from evil&#xA;submerging righteousness. Evil flourishes&#xA;on retaliation.&#xA;They reached the Pandava camp.&#xA;Dhrishtadyumna had doffed his armor and&#xA;was plunged in deep slumber in his tent.&#xA;Aswatthama leapt on the sleeping warrior&#xA;and, before he could put himself into a&#xA;posture of defence, cruelly kicked him to&#xA;death.&#xA;The same process was relentlessly&#xA;repeated until all the Panchalas and all the&#xA;sons of Draupadi were killed one by one&#xA;when they were plunged in sleep in their&#xA;tents.After having done this deed, the like of&#xA;which had never before been considered&#xA;possible among kshatriyas, Kripacharya,&#xA;Kritavarma and Aswatthama came out of&#xA;the tents and set fire to the camp. When&#xA;the fire spread, the sleeping soldiers were&#xA;awakened and fled hither and thither in&#xA;confusion, even like the crows on the&#xA;banian tree under which they had rested in&#xA;the forest, and they were mercilessly&#xA;slaughtered by Aswatthama.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We have done our duty,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Dronacharya&amp;rsquo;s son. &amp;ldquo;Let us go and give&#xA;the glad news to Duryodhana, if we can&#xA;reach him, before he expires. Let him die&#xA;pleased.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The three of them accordingly hurried to&#xA;Duryodhana.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;O, DURYODHANA, you are yet alive,&#xA;hear the news and rejoice! All the&#xA;Panchalas have been slaughtered. The&#xA;sons of the Pandavas have also been all&#xA;done to death. The entire army of theirs&#xA;has been destroyed. We made a night&#xA;attack on them when they were asleep.&#xA;There are only seven survivors now on the&#xA;Pandava side. On our side, Kripacharya,&#xA;Kritavarma and I remain.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus said Aswatthama to the dying&#xA;Duryodhana who, on hearing this, slowly&#xA;opened his eyes and, with struggling&#xA;breath, gasped out these words:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Aswatthama, you have indeed done for&#xA;me what neither the great Bhishma nor the&#xA;valiant Karna could achieve! You have&#xA;gladdened my heart and I die happy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying this, Duryodhana expired.&#xA;When he saw the unexpected destruction&#xA;of his army as a result of the attack during&#xA;sleep, Yudhishthira gave way to grief and&#xA;broke down:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;At the very moment of victory, we have&#xA;been totally defeated. The vanquished&#xA;have&#xA;indeed&#xA;triumphed.&#xA;Draupadi&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;children, who survived the onslaught of&#xA;the formidable Karna, have, by our&#xA;unwariness, been crushed and destroyed&#xA;like vermin. We have allowed ourselves to&#xA;be destroyed like a merchant ship which,&#xA;having successfully crossed the big seas,&#xA;returns home but capsizes in a ditch and is&#xA;lost.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Draupadi&#xA;was&#xA;overwhelmed&#xA;by&#xA;inconsolable&#xA;grief.&#xA;She&#xA;came&#xA;to&#xA;Dharmaputra&amp;rsquo;s side and wept. &amp;ldquo;Is there no&#xA;one to avenge my children&amp;rsquo;s slaughter, by&#xA;destroying this great sinner Aswatthama?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;she cried.&#xA;When she said this, the Pandavas&#xA;immediately went out in search of the&#xA;murderer. They looked for him in all sorts&#xA;of places and found him, at last, on the&#xA;bank of the Ganga, hiding himself behind&#xA;Vyasa.&#xA;When he saw the Pandavas and Janardana&#xA;approaching, Aswatthama quietly took up&#xA;a blade of grass and charged it with the&#xA;mantra of destruction and sent it forward&#xA;saying: &amp;ldquo;May this destroy the race of the&#xA;Pandavas.&amp;rdquo; And it went straight to the&#xA;womb of Uttara who bore in her the son of&#xA;Abhimanyu.&#xA;The race of the Pandavas would have been&#xA;destroyed thereby but for the intervention&#xA;of Sri Krishna who saved the child in the&#xA;mother&amp;rsquo;s womb. This child was Parikshit&#xA;who was later crowned by Yudhishthira&#xA;when the Pandavas retired to the forest.&#xA;Aswatthama pried out the shining jewel&#xA;that was part of his head and gave it to&#xA;Bhima, acknowledging his defeat, and&#xA;went away to the forest. Bhima took the&#xA;great jewel and, going to Draupadi said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Angel of spotless purity, this is for you.&#xA;The man, who killed your beloved sons,&#xA;has been vanquished. Duryodhana has&#xA;been destroyed. I have drunk the blood of&#xA;Duhsasana. I have avenged the great&#xA;outrage and discharged my debts.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Draupadi took the jewel and, going up to&#xA;Yudhishthira bowed and said: &amp;ldquo;Faultlessking, it befits you to wear this in your&#xA;crown.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN the battle was over, Hastinapura&#xA;was a city of mourning. All the women&#xA;and children were weeping and lamenting&#xA;their slain, nearest and dearest. With many&#xA;thousands&#xA;of&#xA;bereaved&#xA;women&#xA;accompanying, Dhritarashtra went to the&#xA;field of battle. At Kurukshetra, the scene&#xA;of terrible destruction, the blind king&#xA;thought of all that had passed, and wept&#xA;aloud. But, of what avail was weeping?&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O king, words of consolation addressed&#xA;to a bereaved person do not remove his&#xA;grief. Thousands of rulers have given up&#xA;their lives in battle for your sons. It is now&#xA;time that you should arrange for proper&#xA;funeral ceremonies for the dead,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Sanjaya to Dhritarashtra.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;It is not right to grieve for those who die&#xA;in battle. When souls have left their&#xA;bodies, there is nothing like relationship,&#xA;nothing like brother or son or relative.&#xA;Your sons have really no connection with&#xA;you. Relationship ends with death, being&#xA;only a bodily connection and a mere&#xA;minor incident in the soul&amp;rsquo;s eternal life.&#xA;From the nowhere do lives come, and,&#xA;with death, they again disappear into&#xA;nowhere. Why should we weep for them?&#xA;Those who die in battle after a heroic fight&#xA;go as guests to receive Indra&amp;rsquo;s hospitality.&#xA;Grieving for what is past, you cannot gain&#xA;anything in the nature of dharma, pleasure&#xA;or wealth.&amp;rdquo; Thus, and in many more ways,&#xA;did the wise and good Vidura try to&#xA;assuage the king&amp;rsquo;s grief.&#xA;Vyasa also approached Dhritarashtra&#xA;tenderly and said: &amp;ldquo;Dear son, there is&#xA;nothing that you do not know and which&#xA;you have to learn from me. You know&#xA;very well that all living beings must die.&#xA;This great battle came to reduce earth&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;burden as I have heard from Lord Vishnu&#xA;Himself. That is why this calamity could&#xA;not&#xA;be&#xA;prevented.&#xA;Henceforth,&#xA;Yudhishthira is your son. You should try&#xA;to love him and in that way bear the&#xA;burden of life, giving up grief.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Making his way, through the crowd of&#xA;weeping women Yudhishthira approached&#xA;Dhritarashtra and bowed before him.&#xA;Dhritarashtra embraced Yudhishthira, but&#xA;there was no love in that embrace.&#xA;Then Bhimasena was announced to the&#xA;blind king. &amp;ldquo;Come,&amp;rdquo; said Dhritarashtra.&#xA;But Vasudeva was wise. He gently pushed&#xA;Bhima aside and placed an iron figure&#xA;before the blind Dhritarashtra, knowing&#xA;the&#xA;old&#xA;king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;exceeding&#xA;anger.&#xA;Dhritarashtra hugged the metal statue to&#xA;his bosom in a firm embrace and then the&#xA;thought came to him of how this man had&#xA;killed everyone of his sons. And his wrath&#xA;increased to such a pitch that the image&#xA;was crushed to pieces in his embrace.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ha! My anger has deceived me,&amp;rdquo; cried&#xA;Dhritarashtra. &amp;ldquo;I have killed dear Bhima.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Krishna said to the blind king:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lord, I knew that it would be thus and I&#xA;prevented the disaster. You have not&#xA;killed Bhimasena. You have crushed only&#xA;an iron image that I placed instead before&#xA;you. May your anger be appeased with&#xA;what you have done to this image. Bhima&#xA;is still alive.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The king was composed somewhat and he&#xA;blessed Bhima and the other Pandavas&#xA;who then took leave of him and went to&#xA;Gandhari.&#xA;Vyasa&#xA;was&#xA;with&#xA;Gandhari.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh&#xA;queen,&amp;ldquo;said the rishi, &amp;ldquo;be not angry with&#xA;the Pandavas. Did you not tell them even&#xA;when the battle began: &amp;lsquo;Where there is&#xA;dharma, there surely will be victory&amp;rsquo;? And&#xA;so it has happened. It is not right to let the&#xA;mind dwell on what is past and nurse&#xA;one&amp;rsquo;s anger. You must now call to aid&#xA;your great fortitude.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Gandhari said: &amp;ldquo;Bhagavan, I do not envy&#xA;the victory of the Pandavas. It is true thatgrief for the death of my sons has robbed&#xA;me of my understanding. These Pandavas&#xA;also are my sons. I know that Duhsasana&#xA;and Sakuni brought about this destruction&#xA;of our people. Arjuna and Bhima are&#xA;blameless. Pride brought this battle about&#xA;and my sons deserve the fate they have&#xA;met. I do not complain about it. But then,&#xA;in Vasudeva&amp;rsquo;s presence, Bhima called&#xA;Duryodhana to battle and they fought.&#xA;And, knowing that Duryodhana was&#xA;stronger and could not be defeated in&#xA;single combat, Bhima struck him below&#xA;the navel and killed him. Vasudeva was&#xA;looking on. This was wrong and it is this&#xA;that I find it impossible to forgive.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhima, who heard this, came near and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Mother, I did this to save myself in&#xA;battle. Whether it was right or wrong, you&#xA;should bear with me. Your son was&#xA;invincible in combat and so I did in self-&#xA;protection what was undoubtedly wrong.&#xA;He called Yudhishthira to play and&#xA;deceived him. We had been wronged by&#xA;your son in so many ways. He would not&#xA;give back the kingdom, of which be took&#xA;unlawful possession. And you know what&#xA;your son did to blameless Draupadi. If we&#xA;had killed your son on the spot, when he&#xA;misbehaved in the Hall of Assembly,&#xA;surely you would not have blamed us.&#xA;Bound by Dharmaraja&amp;rsquo;s vow, we&#xA;restrained ourselves with difficulty then.&#xA;We have since discharged honor&amp;rsquo;s debt&#xA;and found satisfaction in battle. Mother,&#xA;you should forgive me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dear son, if you had left but one out of&#xA;my hundred sons and killed all the rest&#xA;and satisfied your anger, I and my old&#xA;husband would have found solace in that&#xA;surviving son for the rest of our lives.&#xA;Where is Dharmaputra? Call him.&amp;rdquo; She&#xA;said.&#xA;Hearing this, Yudhishthira trembled as he,&#xA;with clasped hands, approached Gandhari,&#xA;whose eyes were bound in a cloth in loyal&#xA;lifelong penance for her husband&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;blindness. He bowed low before her and&#xA;said softly:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Queen, the cruel Yudhishthira, who&#xA;killed your sons, stands before you fit to&#xA;be cursed. Do curse me who have&#xA;committed great sin. I care not for life or&#xA;for kingdom.&amp;rdquo; Saying this, he fell on the&#xA;ground and touched her feet.&#xA;Gandhari heaved a deep sigh and stood&#xA;mute. She turned her head aside knowing&#xA;that if, through the cloth with which her&#xA;eyes were bound, her vision fell on the&#xA;prostrate Yudhishthira he would be&#xA;reduced to ashes on the spot. But through&#xA;a little space in the cloth, even as she&#xA;turned her face away, her eyes fell on the&#xA;toe of the prostrate Yudhishthira. At once,&#xA;says the poet, the toe was charred black.&#xA;Arjuna knew the power of bereaved&#xA;Gandhari&amp;rsquo;s wrath, and hid himself behind&#xA;Vasudeva. The wise and good Gandhari&#xA;suppressed all her anger and blessed the&#xA;Pandavas and sent them to Kunti.&#xA;Gandhari turned to Draupadi, who was in&#xA;lamentation, having lost all her sons.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dear girl,&amp;rdquo; said Gandhari. &amp;ldquo;Do not&#xA;grieve. Who can give solace to you and&#xA;me? It is through my fault that this great&#xA;tribe has been destroyed altogether.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE Pandavas performed the til and&#xA;water ceremonies for the peace of the&#xA;souls of the dead warriors and camped on&#xA;the bank of the Ganga for a month.&#xA;One day, Narada appeared before&#xA;Yudhishthira. &amp;ldquo;Son, through Krishna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;grace, the valor of Arjuna and the power&#xA;of your dharma, you were victorious and&#xA;you are the sovereign lord of the land. Are&#xA;you happy?&amp;rdquo; he asked.&#xA;Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Bhagavan, it is true&#xA;the kingdom has come into my&#xA;possession. But my kinsmen are all gone.&#xA;We have lost sons that were dear. This&#xA;victory appears to me but a great defeat. ONarada, we took our own brother for an&#xA;enemy and killed him, even Karna who&#xA;stood rooted like a rock in his honor and&#xA;at whose valor the world wondered. This&#xA;terrible act of slaying our own brothers&#xA;was the result of our sinful attachment to&#xA;our possessions. Karna, on the other hand,&#xA;kept the promise he gave to our mother&#xA;and abstained from killing us. Oh! I am a&#xA;sinner, a low fellow who murdered his&#xA;own brother. My mind is troubled greatly&#xA;at this thought. Karna&amp;rsquo;s feet were so much&#xA;like our mother&amp;rsquo;s feet. In the large hall,&#xA;when that great outrage was committed&#xA;and my anger rose, when I looked at his&#xA;feet, which were so much like Kunti&amp;rsquo;s feet,&#xA;my wrath subsided. I remember that now&#xA;and my grief increases.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So saying, Yudhishthira heaved a deep&#xA;sigh. Narada told him all about Karna and&#xA;the curses that had been pronounced on&#xA;him on various occasions.&#xA;Once, when Karna saw that Arjuna was&#xA;superior to him in archery, he approached&#xA;Drona and entreated him to teach him how&#xA;to wield the Brahmastra. Drona declined&#xA;saying it was not open to him to instruct&#xA;any but a brahmana of faultless conduct or&#xA;a kshatriya who had purified himself by&#xA;much penance. Thereupon, Karna went to&#xA;the Mahendra hills and deceived&#xA;Parasurama by saying that he was a&#xA;brahmana and became his disciple. From&#xA;him he obtained instruction in archery and&#xA;the use of many astras.&#xA;One day, when Karna was practising with&#xA;his bow in the forest near Parasurama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;asrama,&#xA;a&#xA;brahmana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;cow&#xA;was&#xA;accidentally hit and killed. The brahmana&#xA;was angry and uttered a curse on Karna:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;In battle, your chariot wheels will stick in&#xA;the mud and you will be done to death,&#xA;even like this innocent cow which you&#xA;have killed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Parasurama was exceedingly fond of&#xA;Karna and taught him all the archery he&#xA;knew and instructed him fully in the use&#xA;and the withdrawing of the Brahmastra.&#xA;One day, however, he discovered that the&#xA;disciple was not a brahmana. It happened&#xA;tha an an insect bit a hole into Karna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;thigh when one afternoon the teacher had&#xA;fallen asleep on Karna&amp;rsquo;s lap. Karna bore&#xA;the acute pain quietly and did not stir, lest&#xA;the master should wake up. The warm&#xA;blood trickling from the wound woke up&#xA;Parasurama. When he saw what had&#xA;happened, he was angry.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are a kshatriya; otherwise you could&#xA;not have borne this physical pain without&#xA;stirring. Tell me the truth. You are not a&#xA;brahmana. You have deceived your&#xA;teacher. Fool! When your hour comes,&#xA;your knowledge of astras will fail you and&#xA;what you have learnt from me through&#xA;deception will not avail you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Parasurama&amp;rsquo;s wrath against kshatriyas is&#xA;well known and, when he discovered that&#xA;Karna was a kshatriya, he cursed him thus&#xA;in his anger.&#xA;Karna was free in making gifts. One day,&#xA;Indra, who was Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s father, came in&#xA;the garb of a brahmana and begged of&#xA;Karna for a gift of the divine earrings and&#xA;armor with which he had been born.&#xA;Karna took them out and gave them away&#xA;accordingly. From that time, Karna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;strength was reduced.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Karna&amp;rsquo;s pledge to his mother Kunti that&#xA;he would not kill more than one of the&#xA;five of you, Parasurarna&amp;rsquo;s curse, the anger&#xA;of the brahmana whose cow was killed by&#xA;Karna, the way in which his charioteer&#xA;Salya depressed him by underrating his&#xA;valor and Vasudeva&amp;rsquo;s stratagems, these&#xA;combined to bring about Karna&amp;rsquo;s end. Do&#xA;not grieve believing that you alone caused&#xA;his death.&amp;rdquo; Thus said Narada, but&#xA;Yudhishthira was not consoled by these&#xA;words.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do not blame yourself, son, for Karna&amp;rsquo;s,&#xA;death,&amp;rdquo; said Kunti. &amp;ldquo;His father, the sunlord himself, pleaded with him. He&#xA;begged of him to give up the wicked-&#xA;hearted Duryodhana and join you. I too&#xA;tried hard. But he would not listen to us.&#xA;He brought his end on himself.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You&#xA;deceived&#xA;us,&#xA;mother&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said&#xA;Yudhishthira, &amp;ldquo;by hiding the secret of his&#xA;birth from us. You became thus the cause&#xA;of this great sin. May women never be&#xA;able to keep a secret henceforth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This is the poet&amp;rsquo;s story of how&#xA;Yudhishthira cursed all women in his&#xA;anguish over having killed his own elder&#xA;brother. It is a common notion that&#xA;women cannot keep secrets. And this&#xA;story is a beautiful conception illustrating&#xA;that popular belief.&#xA;It may be that in worldly affairs, it is an&#xA;advantage to be able to keep secrets. But it&#xA;is not great virtue from the point of view&#xA;of moral character, and women need not&#xA;grieve over an incapacity of this kind, if&#xA;indeed Kunti&amp;rsquo;s legacy still persists.&#xA;The affectionate temperament natural to&#xA;women may perhaps incline them to&#xA;openness. But some women do keep&#xA;secrets very well indeed, and not a man&#xA;possess this ability either. It is a fallacy to&#xA;attribute the differences that arise out of&#xA;training and occupation on nature itself&#xA;and imagine some qualities as peculiar to&#xA;a sex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YUDHISHTHIRA&amp;rsquo;S&#xA;pain&#xA;of&#xA;mind&#xA;increased everyday as he thought of all the&#xA;kinsmen that had been killed. He was&#xA;stricken with intense remorse and decided&#xA;he must give up the world go to the forest&#xA;and do penance to expiate his sin.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I see no joy or good,&amp;rdquo; he said to his&#xA;brothers, in taking up the office of king or&#xA;in worldly enjoyment. Do rule the land&#xA;yourselves leaving me free to go to the&#xA;forest.&amp;quot;&#xA;Arjuna talked of the nobility of family life&#xA;and the entire good one may do without&#xA;taking sanyasa. Bhimasena also spoke and&#xA;harshly.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You talk, alas&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;like a dull-&#xA;witted person who has committed to&#xA;memory the texts of the sastras without&#xA;understanding their sense. Sanyasa is not&#xA;the dharma of kshatriyas. The duty of a&#xA;kshatriya, is to live an active life and&#xA;perform his proper task, not to go to the&#xA;forest renouncing activity.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Nakula also contested the propriety of&#xA;Dharmaputra&amp;rsquo;s proposal and insisted that&#xA;the path of work was the right one to&#xA;follow and the way of sanyasa was beset&#xA;with difficulties.&#xA;Sahadeva also argued likewise and&#xA;entreated: &amp;ldquo;You are my father, my mother,&#xA;my teacher, as well as brother. Do not&#xA;leave us, bear with us.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Draupadi also spoke. &amp;ldquo;It was right we&#xA;killed Duryodhana and his men. Why&#xA;should we regret it? Among the duties of a&#xA;king is included the inflicting of just&#xA;punishment. It cannot be avoided and is&#xA;an essential part of the ruler&amp;rsquo;s duty. You&#xA;have meted just punishment too evildoers.&#xA;There is no cause whatsoever for&#xA;contrition. It is now your sacred duty to&#xA;take up the burden of governing the land&#xA;according to dharma. Cease grieving.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Vyasa spoke to Yudhishthira at&#xA;length and explained where his duty lay,&#xA;pointing out precedents, and persuaded&#xA;him to go to the city and take up the&#xA;burden of ruling the land.&#xA;Yudhishthira was duly crowned at&#xA;Hastinapura. Before taking up the duties&#xA;of the State, Yudhishthira went to where&#xA;Bhishma lay on his bed of arrows&#xA;awaiting his death, and took his blessing&#xA;and instruction in dharma. This instruction&#xA;of Bhishmacharya to king Yudhishthira is&#xA;the&#xA;famous&#xA;Santiparva&#xA;of&#xA;the&#xA;Mahabharata. After the discourse was&#xA;over, Bhishma&amp;rsquo;s soul passed out. The king&#xA;went to the Ganga and offered libations,in accordance with ancient custom, for the&#xA;peace of the departed soul.&#xA;After&#xA;the&#xA;ceremony&#xA;was&#xA;over,&#xA;Yudhishthira went up the bank. There, as&#xA;he stood for a while, all the tragic events&#xA;came back to his mind, and overcome by&#xA;intense grief, he fell senseless on the&#xA;ground, like an elephant struck down by&#xA;the hunter.&#xA;Bhima went up to his big brother and&#xA;caressed him tenderly and spoke to him&#xA;soothing words. Dhritarashtra also came&#xA;up and said to Yudhishthira:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You should not grieve like this. Arise&#xA;and, assisted by your brothers and friends,&#xA;reign over the kingdom that awaits your&#xA;rule. Your duty now is to do what&#xA;appertains to the office of king. Leave&#xA;grief to Gandhari and me. You achieved&#xA;victory in battle in accordance with the&#xA;dharma&#xA;of&#xA;warriors.&#xA;The&#xA;duties&#xA;appertaining to that victory await your&#xA;attention now. Fool that I was, I did not&#xA;pay heed to the words of Vidura and&#xA;committed a great error. I listened to the&#xA;ignorant words of Duryodhana and&#xA;deceived myself. Like gold seen in a&#xA;dream the glory has vanished. My&#xA;hundred sons have disappeared into the&#xA;world of nowhere. But I have you as my&#xA;son now. Do not grieve.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>099 ENVY</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AFTER the libation ceremony for&#xA;Bhishma was over, Vyasa narrated to&#xA;grief-stricken Yudhishthira an episode in&#xA;Brihaspati&amp;rsquo;s life. The wisest of men are&#xA;sometimes affected by envy and suffer&#xA;thereby. Brihaspati, teacher to the gods&#xA;themselves, was master of all knowledge.&#xA;He was learned in all the Vedas and all the&#xA;sciences, yet he was once the victim of&#xA;this debasing emotion and suffered&#xA;disgrace.&#xA;Brihaspati had a younger brother,&#xA;Samvarta, who was also a person of great&#xA;learning and a very good man. Brihaspati&#xA;was, for this reason, stricken with envy of&#xA;his brother.&#xA;In this world men become envious of&#xA;others, just because the others are good,&#xA;while they themselves are not so good,&#xA;and they cannot bear this. It is strange&#xA;indeed that men should not suffer even&#xA;virtue in others.&#xA;Brihaspati harassed Samvarta in many&#xA;ways. When he could not stand it any&#xA;more, poor Samvarta put on the&#xA;appearance of an eccentric and wandered&#xA;from place to place, and spent his days in&#xA;that way to escape from his brother&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;persecution.&#xA;King Marutta of the Ikshwaku dynasty&#xA;made great penance and obtained from the&#xA;Lord of Kailasa a great goldmine in the&#xA;Himalayas and, with his resources thus&#xA;augmented, he decided to perform a great&#xA;Yajna.&#xA;Marutta requested Brihaspati to conduct&#xA;the yajna for him. But Brihaspati feared&#xA;that Marutta would, as a result of the&#xA;yajna, overshadow the gods who were his&#xA;charge.&#xA;He refused to comply with the king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;invitation, despite his pressing entreaties.&#xA;Thereupon, king Marutta, who had come&#xA;to know about Samvarta found his&#xA;whereabouts and approached him with the&#xA;invitation to conduct his yajna.&#xA;He at first refused and tried to avoid the&#xA;honor, but finally yielded. This further&#xA;increased Brihaspati&amp;rsquo;s envy of his&#xA;unfortunate brother.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Here is this enemy of mine, Samvarta,&#xA;going to conduct king Marutta&amp;rsquo;s great&#xA;yajna. What shall I do now?&amp;rdquo; Thus did&#xA;Brihaspati brood over it until his envy&#xA;affected his health. His health declined&#xA;rapidly and he became thin and pale. His&#xA;condition grew worse everyday, until it&#xA;attracted the attention of Indra himself.&#xA;Indra, chief of the gods, approached the&#xA;divine preceptor and saluting him asked:&amp;ldquo;Lord, why are you ill? What has caused&#xA;this languishing? Do you sleep well? Do&#xA;the attendants serve you properly? Do&#xA;they anticipate your wishes and not wait&#xA;to be told? Do the gods behave&#xA;courteously towards you or has there been&#xA;any lapse in this respect?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;To Indra&amp;rsquo;s anxious inquiry, Brihaspati&#xA;replied: &amp;ldquo;Deva raja, I sleep on a good bed&#xA;and in right time. The attendants serve me&#xA;with all devotion. There is nothing&#xA;wanting in the respect and courtesies&#xA;shown by the gods.&amp;rdquo; Then his voice failed&#xA;and he could not proceed. So great was his&#xA;prostration of spirit.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why are you grieved?&amp;rdquo; asked Indra&#xA;affectionately. &amp;ldquo;Why have you grown thin&#xA;and bloodless? Tell me what troubles your&#xA;mind.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Brihaspati then told Indra about it all.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Samvarta is going to conduct a great&#xA;yajna. It is this that has made me wan and&#xA;thin. I cannot help it,&amp;rdquo; said he. Indra was&#xA;surprised.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Learned brahmana, there is no object of&#xA;desire that is not already yours. You are&#xA;wise and learned, and the gods themselves&#xA;have accepted you as their priest and wise&#xA;counselor. What harm can Samvarta do to&#xA;you? There is nothing you can lose on&#xA;account of him. Why do you needlessly&#xA;take upon yourself this suffering by mere&#xA;envy?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It was amusing that Indra should so far&#xA;and so humanly forget his own history as&#xA;to give counsel of good conduct. But&#xA;Brihaspati refreshed his memory on the&#xA;point and asked: &amp;ldquo;Would you yourself&#xA;delightedly watch your enemy&amp;rsquo;s power&#xA;growing? Judge me by how you would&#xA;have felt had you been in my position. I&#xA;beg of you to save me against this&#xA;Samvarta. You must find a way to put this&#xA;man down.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Indra sent for Agni and said to him: &amp;ldquo;Go&#xA;and stop the yajna of Marutta somehow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The god of fire agreed and went on this&#xA;mission. The trees and the creepers along&#xA;his path caught fire and the earth trembled&#xA;as he marched roaring.&#xA;He presented himself before the king in&#xA;his divine form.&#xA;The king was mightily pleased to see Agni&#xA;stand before him. He ordered the&#xA;attendants to do all the usual honors of&#xA;hospitality. &amp;ldquo;Let him be duly seated. Have&#xA;his feet laved and bring the gifts proper to&#xA;his greatness,&amp;rdquo; said the king, and this was&#xA;done.&#xA;Agni then explained why he had come.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do give up this Samvarta. If you require&#xA;a priest, I shall bring Brihaspati himself to&#xA;help you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Samvarta, who heard this, was indignant.&#xA;The wrath of one who led the strict life of&#xA;a brahmacharin was exceedingly potent.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Stop this chatter!&amp;rdquo; he said to Agni. &amp;ldquo;Do&#xA;not let my anger burn you up.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Fire reduces things to ashes, but&#xA;brahmacharya can burn up fire itself!&#xA;At Samvarta&amp;rsquo;s anger Agni, trembling like&#xA;an aspen leaf, retired quickly. He returned&#xA;to Indra and told him what had happened.&#xA;The king of the gods could not believe the&#xA;story. &amp;ldquo;Agni, you burn up other things in&#xA;the world. How can anything burn you?&#xA;What is this story of Samvarta’s angry&#xA;eyes reducing you to ashes?&amp;rdquo;&#39;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Not so, king of the gods,&amp;rdquo; said Agni.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Brahmic power and the potency born of&#xA;brahmacharya are not unknown to you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Agni thus reminded Indra of what the&#xA;latter had suffered; incurring the wrath of&#xA;those whom had attained Brahmic power.&#xA;Indra did not wrangle but called a&#xA;Gandharva had said: &amp;ldquo;Now, Agni has&#xA;failed. I want you to go as my messenger&#xA;and ask Marutta to give up Samvarta. Tell&#xA;him that if he does not, he will incur my&#xA;wrath and be destroyed.&amp;ldquo;The Gandharva went accordingly to king&#xA;Marutta and faithfully conveyed Indra&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;message and warning.&#xA;The king would not listen. &amp;ldquo;I cannot be&#xA;guilty of the deadly sin of deserting a&#xA;trusting friend,&amp;rdquo; said the king: &amp;ldquo;I cannot&#xA;give up Samvarta.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Gandharva said: &amp;ldquo;O king, how can&#xA;you survive, when Indra hurls his bolt at&#xA;you?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Even as he said this, the clouds above&#xA;thundered and everyone knew that the god&#xA;of the thunderbolt was coming, and&#xA;trembled in fear.&#xA;The king was in great fear and entreated&#xA;Samvarta to save him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Fear not,&amp;rdquo; said Samvarta to the king, and&#xA;he proceeded to put the power of his&#xA;penance into action.&#xA;Indra, who had come to do battle, was&#xA;compelled to change over to benevolent&#xA;peace and to take part in the yajna as the&#xA;radiant god of sacrifices. He received the&#xA;burnt offering in proper form and retired.&#xA;Brihaspati&amp;rsquo;s plan of envy failed miserably.&#xA;Brahmacharya triumphed. Envy is a&#xA;deadly sin. It is a universal disease. If&#xA;Brihaspati who could defeat the goddess&#xA;of knowledge herself in learning became a&#xA;victim to envy, what is there to say about&#xA;ordinary mortals?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN the battle was over, Krishna bade&#xA;farewell to the Pandavas and went to&#xA;Dwaraka. While on his way, he met his&#xA;old brahmana friend Utanga. Krishna&#xA;stopped and descending from his chariot&#xA;saluted the brahmana.&#xA;Utanga returned the greeting and&#xA;proceeded to make the usual inquiries&#xA;about the health and welfare of relatives.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Madhava, do your cousins the Pandavas&#xA;and the Kauravas love one another as&#xA;brothers should? Are they well and&#xA;flourishing?&amp;rdquo; he asked.&#xA;The innocent recluse had not heard about&#xA;the great battle that had been fought.&#xA;Krishna was astounded at the question of&#xA;his brahmana friend. For a while, he stood&#xA;silent not knowing what to say in reply.&#xA;Then he softly disclosed what had&#xA;happened.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sir, a terrible battle had been fought by&#xA;the Pandavas and the Kauravas, I tried&#xA;hard and applied every means to prevent&#xA;the fight and make peace between them.&#xA;But they would not listen. Almost all of&#xA;them have perished on the field of battle.&#xA;Who can stop the hand of fate?&amp;rdquo; Then he&#xA;related all that had happened.&#xA;When Utanga heard the narrative, he was&#xA;exceedingly wroth. With eyes red with&#xA;indignation he spoke to Madhava:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Vasudeva, were you there standing by&#xA;and did you let all this happen? You have&#xA;indeed failed in your duty. You have&#xA;surely practised deceit and led them to&#xA;destruction. Prepare now to receive my&#xA;curse!&amp;rdquo; Vasudeva smiled and said: &amp;ldquo;Peace,&#xA;peace! Calm yourself. Do not use up the&#xA;fruit of your great penances in this anger.&#xA;Listen to what I say and then, if you like,&#xA;you may pronounce your curse.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Krishna pacified the indignant brahmana&#xA;and appeared to him in his all-embracing&#xA;form, the Viswarupa.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I am born in various bodies from time to&#xA;time to save the world and establish the&#xA;good. In whatever body I am born, I must&#xA;act in conformity with the nature of that&#xA;body. When I am born as a Deva, I act as&#xA;a Deva does. If I appear as a Yaksha or as&#xA;a Rakshasa, I do everything like a Yaksha&#xA;or a Rakshasa. If I am born as a human&#xA;being, or as a beast, I do what is natural to&#xA;that birth and complete my task. I begged&#xA;very hard of the ignorant Kauravas. They&#xA;were arrogant and intoxicated by power&#xA;and paid no heed to my advice. I tried to&#xA;intimidate them. Therein also I failed. I&#xA;was in wrath and showed them even myViswarupa. Even that failed to have an&#xA;effect. They persisted in wrongdoing.&#xA;They waged war and perished. O best&#xA;among brahmanas, you have no reason to&#xA;be angry with me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After this explanation of Krishna, Utanga&#xA;recovered his calm. Krishna was,&#xA;delighted.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I wish to give a boon to you. What would&#xA;you like?&amp;rdquo; said Krishna.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Achchyuta,&amp;rdquo; said Utanga, &amp;ldquo;is it not&#xA;enough I have seen Thee and Thy Form&#xA;Universal? I do not desire any further&#xA;boon.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Krishna insisted and the desert&#xA;wandering simple brahmana said: &amp;ldquo;Well,&#xA;my Lord, if you must give me some boon,&#xA;let me find water to drink whenever I&#xA;might feel thirsty. Give me this boon.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Krishna smiled. &amp;ldquo;Is this all? Have it then,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he said, and proceeded on his journey.&#xA;One day Utanga was very thirsty and,&#xA;unable to find water anywhere in the&#xA;desert, he bethought himself of the boon&#xA;he had received.&#xA;As soon as be did this, a Nishada appeared&#xA;before him, clothed in filthy rags. He had&#xA;five hunting hounds in leash and a water-&#xA;skin strapped to his shoulder.&#xA;The Nishada grinned at Utanga and&#xA;saying, &amp;ldquo;You seem to be thirsty. Here is&#xA;water for you,&amp;rdquo; offered the bamboo spout&#xA;of his water-skin to the brahmana to drink&#xA;from.&#xA;Utanga, looking at the man and his dogs&#xA;and his water skin, said in disgust:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Friend, I do not need it, thank you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying this, he thought of Krishna and&#xA;reproached him in his mind: &amp;ldquo;Indeed, was&#xA;this all the boon you gave me?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The outcaste Nishada pressed Utanga over&#xA;and over again to quench his thirst, but it&#xA;only made Utanga more and more angry&#xA;and he refused to drink. The hunter and&#xA;his dogs disappeared.&#xA;Seeing the strange disappearance of the&#xA;Nishada, Utanga reflected: &amp;ldquo;Who was&#xA;this? He could not have been a real&#xA;Nishada. It was certainly a test and I have&#xA;blundered miserably. My philosophy&#xA;deserted me. I rejected the water offered&#xA;by the Nishada and proved myself to be&#xA;an arrogant fool.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Utanga was in great anguish. A moment&#xA;later Madhava himself appeared with&#xA;conch and discus. &amp;ldquo;O Purushottama!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;exclaimed Utanga; &amp;ldquo;you put me to a&#xA;difficult trial. Was it right of you to try me&#xA;thus? Make an untouchable offer unclean&#xA;water to me, a brahmana, to drink. Was&#xA;this kind?&amp;rdquo; asked Utanga. Utanga spoke in&#xA;bitter tones.&#xA;Janardana smiled. &amp;ldquo;O Utanga, for your&#xA;sake, when you put my boon into action, I&#xA;asked Indra to take amrita to you and give&#xA;it to you as water. He said he could not&#xA;give to a mortal what would give him&#xA;immortality, while he was willing to do&#xA;anything else. But I prevailed upon him&#xA;and he agreed to take amrita and give it to&#xA;you as water, provided I let him do it as a&#xA;Chandala and tested your understanding&#xA;and found you willing to take water from&#xA;a Chandala. I accepted the challenge&#xA;believing you had attained jnana and&#xA;transcended externals. But you have done&#xA;this and made me suffer defeat at Indra&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;hands.&amp;rdquo; Utanga saw his mistake and was&#xA;ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN Yudhishthira was crowned and&#xA;installed as king after the Kurukshetra&#xA;battle, he performed an aswamedha yajna.&#xA;As was the custom on occasions of this&#xA;great horse sacrifice, all the princes of the&#xA;land gathered on invitation and the yajna&#xA;was completed in great splendor. The&#xA;brahmanas and the poor and the destitute&#xA;people, who had come in great numbers&#xA;from all parts of the country, received&#xA;bounteous gifts. Everything was done inmagnificent style and in conformity With&#xA;the injunctions relating to the sacrifice.&#xA;From somewhere unseen, a weasel&#xA;suddenly appeared right in the middle of&#xA;the assembled guests and priests in the&#xA;great pavilion and, after rolling on the&#xA;ground laughed a loud human laugh as if&#xA;in derision. The priests were alarmed at&#xA;this strange and unnatural occurrence and&#xA;wondered whether it was some evil spirit&#xA;that had come to pollute and disturb the&#xA;sacred rites.&#xA;The weasel&amp;rsquo;s body was on one side all&#xA;shining gold. This remarkable creature&#xA;turned round and took a good view of the&#xA;assembly&#xA;of&#xA;princes&#xA;and&#xA;learned&#xA;brahmanas that had come from various&#xA;countries and gathered in that great&#xA;pavilion and began to speak:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Princes assembled and priests, listen to&#xA;me. You no doubt believe that you have&#xA;completed your yajna in splendid style.&#xA;Once upon a time, a poor brahmana who&#xA;lived in Kurukshetra made a gift of a&#xA;pound of maize flour. Your great horse&#xA;sacrifice and all the gifts made in that&#xA;connection are less than that small gift of&#xA;the Kurukshetra brahmana. You seem to&#xA;think too much of your yajna. Pray, be not&#xA;so vain about it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The gathering was amazed at this strange&#xA;and impertinent speech of the golden&#xA;weasel. The brahmana priests, who had&#xA;performed the sacrificial rites, went up to&#xA;the weasel and spoke to it:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Wherefrom and why have you come to&#xA;this yajna, performed by good and worthy&#xA;men? Who are you? Why do you utter&#xA;words of scorn about our sacrifice? This&#xA;aswamedha has been duly completed in&#xA;every detail in accordance with sastraic&#xA;injunctions. It is not proper that you&#xA;should speak derisively of our great&#xA;sacrifice. Everyone that has come to this&#xA;yajna has been duly attended to and has&#xA;been accorded suitable honors and gifts.&#xA;Everyone is pleased with the gifts and&#xA;returns happy and contented. The mantras&#xA;have been chanted perfectly and the&#xA;oblations duly offered. The four castes are&#xA;pleased. Why do you speak as you do? Do&#xA;explain yourself.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The weasel laughed again and said: &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;brahmanas, what I said is true. I do not&#xA;grudge the good fortune of king&#xA;Yudhishthira or the good fortune of any of&#xA;you. It is not envy that makes me say this.&#xA;The yajna, which you have just completed&#xA;so showily, is not in truth as great an act&#xA;as that gift of the poor brahmana, which I&#xA;have seen. And in reward for his gift, he&#xA;and his wife, son and daughter-in-law&#xA;were immediately taken to swarga. Listen&#xA;to my story which is a true narrative of&#xA;what I saw myself. Long before you&#xA;waged your battle there, a brahmana, lived&#xA;in Kurukshetra, who obtained his daily&#xA;food by gleaning in the fields. He and his&#xA;wife, son and daughter-in-law, all four&#xA;lived in this manner. Everyday in the&#xA;afternoon they would sit down and have&#xA;their only meal for the day. On days when&#xA;they failed to find enough grain, they&#xA;would fast until the next afternoon. They&#xA;would not keep over any thing for the next&#xA;day if they got more than they required for&#xA;the day. This was the strict unchhavritti&#xA;discipline they had pledged themselves to&#xA;observe. They passed their days thus for&#xA;many years, when a great drought came&#xA;and there was famine all over the land. All&#xA;cultivation ceased and there was neither&#xA;sowing nor harvesting nor any grain&#xA;scattered in the fields to be gleaned. For&#xA;many days the brahmana and his family&#xA;starved. One day, after wandering in&#xA;hunger and heat, with great difficulty they&#xA;came home with a small quantity of&#xA;maize, which they had gathered. They&#xA;ground it and after saying their prayers&#xA;they divided the flour into four equal parts&#xA;and, offering thanks to God, sat downeagerly to eat. Just then, a brahmana&#xA;entered and he was exceedingly hungry.&#xA;Seeing an unexpected guest arrive, they&#xA;got up and made due obeisance and asked&#xA;him to join them. The pure-souled&#xA;brahmana and his wife and son and&#xA;daughter-in-law&#xA;were&#xA;exceedingly&#xA;delighted to have the good fortune of&#xA;receiving guest at that juncture. &amp;lsquo;Oh best&#xA;of brahmanas, I am a poor man. This flour&#xA;of maize was obtained in accordance with&#xA;dharma. Pray accept this. May blessings&#xA;attend on you,&amp;rsquo; said the brahmana of&#xA;Kurukshetra and gave his share of the&#xA;flour to the guest. The guest ate it with&#xA;avidity but he was still hungry when he&#xA;had finished. Seeing his hungry and&#xA;unsatisfied look, the brahmana was&#xA;grieved and did not know what to do,&#xA;when his wife said: &amp;lsquo;Lord, give my share&#xA;also to him. I shall be glad if the guest&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;hunger he satisfied.&amp;rsquo; Saying this, she&#xA;handed her share of the flour to her&#xA;husband to be given to the guest. &amp;lsquo;Faithful&#xA;one,&amp;rsquo; said the brahmana, &amp;rsquo;the beasts and&#xA;the birds and all the animals tend the&#xA;females of their species with care. May&#xA;man do worse? I cannot accept your&#xA;suggestion. What shall I gain in this or in&#xA;the other world if I leave you to starve and&#xA;suffer hunger, you who help me and serve&#xA;me to do the sacred duties of a&#xA;householder&amp;rsquo;s life? Beloved one, you are&#xA;now skin and bone and famished and&#xA;exceedingly hungry. How can I leave you&#xA;to suffer in that condition and hope to&#xA;attain any good by feeding the guest? No,&#xA;I cannot accept your offer.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;You are&#xA;versed in the sastras, best of brahmanas&amp;rsquo;,&#xA;replied the wife. &amp;lsquo;Is it not true that dharma,&#xA;artha and all the objects of human activity&#xA;are to the common and equal benefit of&#xA;both of us who have been joined together?&#xA;Do look on me with compassion and take&#xA;my share of the flour and satisfy the&#xA;requirements of this our guest. You are&#xA;hungry as I am and you should not make&#xA;any distinction between us. I entreat you&#xA;not to deny my request.&amp;rsquo; The brahmana&#xA;yielded and took the wife&amp;rsquo;s share and gave&#xA;it to the guest who took it greedily and ate&#xA;it. But he was still hungry! Great was the&#xA;distress of the poor brahmana of&#xA;Kurukshetra. His son, who saw this, came&#xA;forward. &amp;lsquo;Father, here is my share,&amp;rsquo; said&#xA;he. &amp;lsquo;Give it to this guest who seems to be&#xA;still hungry. I shall be indeed happy if we&#xA;shall thus be able to fulfil our duty.&amp;rsquo; The&#xA;father&amp;rsquo;s distress increased. &amp;lsquo;Child!&amp;rsquo; he&#xA;exclaimed, &amp;lsquo;old men can stand starvation.&#xA;Youth&amp;rsquo;s hunger is severe. I am not able to&#xA;find it in my heart to accept what you say.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;The son insisted: &amp;lsquo;it is the duty of the son&#xA;to look after his father in his declining&#xA;years. The son is not different from the&#xA;father. Is it not said that the father is born&#xA;afresh in his son? My share of the flour is&#xA;yours in truth. I beg of you to accept what&#xA;I give and feed this hungry guest.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Dear&#xA;boy, your nobility and your mastery over&#xA;the senses fill me with pride. Blessing on&#xA;you. I shall accept your share!&amp;rsquo; said the&#xA;father, and he took the son&amp;rsquo;s flour and&#xA;gave it to the guest to eat. The guest ate&#xA;the third part of the flour also but he was&#xA;still hungry! The brahmana, who lived on&#xA;scattered grain, was confused. While he&#xA;was in distress, not knowing that to do, his&#xA;daughter-in-law addressed him thus:&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Lord, I shall give my share too and gladly&#xA;complete our efforts to feed this guest. I&#xA;beg of you to accept it and bless me, your&#xA;child, for, by that, I shall have eternal&#xA;good as my reward.&amp;rsquo; The father-in-law&#xA;was sad beyond measure. &amp;lsquo;O girl of&#xA;spotless character, pale and emaciated as&#xA;you are from starvation, you propose to&#xA;give your part of the food also to me, so&#xA;that I may earn merit by giving it to this&#xA;guest. If I accept your offer, I shall indeed&#xA;be guilty of cruelty. How could I possibly&#xA;look on when you wither in hunger?&amp;rsquo; Thegirl would not listen. &amp;lsquo;Father, you are lord&#xA;of my lord and master, preceptor of my&#xA;preceptor, god of my god. I implore you&#xA;to accept my flour. Is not this body of&#xA;mine dedicated wholly to serve my lord?&#xA;You should help me to attain the good. Do&#xA;take this flour, I entreat you.&amp;rsquo; Thus&#xA;implored by his daughter-in-law, the&#xA;brahmana accepted her share of the flour&#xA;and blessed her saying: &amp;lsquo;Loyal girl, may&#xA;every good be yours!&amp;rsquo; The guest received&#xA;this last portion avidly and ate it and was&#xA;satisfied. &amp;lsquo;Blessed is your hospitality,&#xA;given with the purest intent and to the&#xA;uttermost of your capacity. Your gift has&#xA;leased me. Lo there, the gods are&#xA;showering flowers in admiration of your&#xA;extraordinary sacrifice. See the gods and&#xA;the Gandharvas have come down in their&#xA;bright chariots with their attendants to&#xA;take you with your family to the happy&#xA;regions above. Your gift has achieved&#xA;swarga for you, as well as for your&#xA;ancestors.&#xA;Hunger&#xA;destroys&#xA;the&#xA;understanding of men. It makes them go&#xA;aside from the path of rectitude. It leads&#xA;them to evil thoughts. The pious, when&#xA;suffering the pangs of hunger, lose their&#xA;steadfastness. But you have, even when&#xA;hungry, bravely set aside your attachment&#xA;to wife and son and placed dharma above&#xA;all else. Rajasuya sacrifices and horse&#xA;sacrifices completed in splendor, would&#xA;pale into insignificance before the great&#xA;sacrifice you have done through this&#xA;single act of hospitality. The chariot is&#xA;waiting for you. Enter and go to swarga,&#xA;you and your family.&amp;rsquo; Saying this the&#xA;mysterious guest disappeared.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having related this story of the&#xA;Kurukshetra brahmana who lived by&#xA;gleaning scattered ears of corn in the field,&#xA;the weasel continued:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I was nearby and caught the fragrance&#xA;wafted from that flour of the brahmana. It&#xA;made my head all gold. I then went and&#xA;rolled in joy on the ground where some of&#xA;the flour had been scattered. It made one&#xA;side of me into bright gold. I turned on the&#xA;other side but there was no more flour left&#xA;and that part of me is still as it was.&#xA;Desirous of getting my body made all&#xA;gold, I have been trying every place where&#xA;men perform great yajnas and penances. I&#xA;heard that Yudhishthira of world fame&#xA;was performing a yajna and came here,&#xA;believing that this sacrifice might come up&#xA;to the standard. But I found it did not. So,&#xA;I said that your great aswamedha was not&#xA;so great as the loft of flour which that&#xA;brahmana made to his guest.&amp;rdquo; The weasel&#xA;then disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MAN pursues madly the object of his&#xA;desire until it is got. When it is in his&#xA;possession, he is soon satisfied, but he&#xA;becomes the slave of ever-fresh longings&#xA;and fresh griefs and finds no peace.&#xA;Although to fight and to kill his enemies&#xA;is a Kshatriyas dharma, what joy can one&#xA;gets out of power and position and wealth&#xA;acquired by slaughter and grief inflicted&#xA;on brothers and near relations? It was this&#xA;that Arjuna pointed out in his powerful&#xA;plea before Krishna when the battle&#xA;commenced. Krishna in answer, explained&#xA;the principles of man&amp;rsquo;s activities and the&#xA;proper discharge of one&amp;rsquo;s duties. But, what&#xA;Arjuna felt and argued had also a great&#xA;deal of force and there was more truth in it&#xA;than appeared on the surface.&#xA;The Pandavas defeated the Kauravas and&#xA;became the unquestioned sovereigns of&#xA;the land. They took up their duties and&#xA;discharged them according to dharma.&#xA;But, they found not in victory, the joy that&#xA;they had expected.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;When the Pandavas won and obtained&#xA;the kingdom, how did they treat&#xA;Dhritarashtra?&amp;rdquo; asked king Janamejaya,&#xA;and Vaisampayana, who recited Vyasa&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;Mahabharata to the king, tells the story.The Pandavas with the utmost respect&#xA;treated Dhritarashtra, who was plunged in&#xA;a sea of grief. They tried to make him&#xA;happy. They did nothing to make him feel&#xA;humiliated. Yudhishthira issued no orders&#xA;except with his approval. Gandhari, whose&#xA;hundred sons had disappeared like dream-&#xA;gold, was looked after by Kuntidevi with&#xA;loving and sisterly devotion and Draupadi&#xA;dutifully ministered to them both, with&#xA;equal respect.&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;furnished&#xA;Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;house with rich seats and beds and&#xA;decorations and all else that was wanted.&#xA;He sent from the royal kitchen most&#xA;dainty and palatable dishes prepared for&#xA;him. Kripacharya, lived with Dhritarashtra&#xA;and kept him company. Vyasa comforted&#xA;him with instructive stories of olden&#xA;times, calculated to assuage his sorrow.&#xA;In the administration of affairs of the&#xA;State,&#xA;Yudhishthira&#xA;consulted&#xA;Dhritarashtra and conducted himself so as&#xA;to give him the feeling that in truth the&#xA;kingdom was ruled on his behalf and that&#xA;he, as the eldest member of the family,&#xA;was still the supreme authority.&#xA;Yudhishthira was most careful in his&#xA;speech, never to allow himself to say&#xA;anything to cause pain to the bereaved old&#xA;man. The princes, who came to&#xA;Hastinapura from all parts of the world,&#xA;gave Dhritarashtra the same honors; as&#xA;they did of old, as if he were still the&#xA;emperor.&#xA;The women attendants gave Gandhari no&#xA;occasion to feel her fallen estate.&#xA;Yudhishthira had instructed his brothers&#xA;most strictly that nothing should be done&#xA;to cause the slightest pain to their uncle,&#xA;who had lost all his sons.&#xA;The brothers, with perhaps the exception&#xA;of Bhima, followed this injunction&#xA;faithfully. Dhritarashtra too conducted&#xA;himself lovingly towards the Pandavas.&#xA;He showed no ill will towards them even&#xA;as they showed him no unkindness. The&#xA;Pandavas&#xA;behaved&#xA;unexceptionably&#xA;towards their old uncle. After a time,&#xA;however, Bhima began on occasions to&#xA;give cause for offence. He would&#xA;sometimes, in impatience, countermand&#xA;the old man&amp;rsquo;s instructions. He would let&#xA;fall in Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s hearing words like&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Those perverse cousins of ours have&#xA;themselves to thank for their destruction.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It was not possible for Bhima to forget or&#xA;forgive Duryodhana, Karna or Duhsasana.&#xA;Gandhari felt intensely grieved when she&#xA;noticed that Bhima uttered words, which&#xA;pained Dhritarashtra. She was, however, a&#xA;noble and enlightened soul. Whenever she&#xA;felt pained at what Bhima said, she would&#xA;look at Kunti and find peace. For Kunti&#xA;was a veritable embodiment of dharma&#xA;and inspired forbearance. Fifteen years&#xA;passed in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FIFTEEN years passed under king&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;reign,&#xA;when&#xA;old&#xA;Dhritarashtra found himself utterly unable&#xA;any longer to bear the burden of grief.&#xA;Hurt by Bhima&amp;rsquo;s occasional reproaches, he&#xA;found no heart to accept the courtesies and&#xA;comforts&#xA;provided&#xA;under&#xA;king&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s orders. Unknown to the&#xA;Pandavas, he secretly fasted and&#xA;underwent hard penances.&#xA;Gandhari too observed manifests and&#xA;inflicted privation on her. And one day&#xA;Dhritarashtra sent for Dharmaputra and&#xA;spoke to him thus:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Son, blessings on you. I have spent&#xA;fifteen happy years under your roof. You&#xA;have tended me most lovingly. I have&#xA;made gifts and offerings to ancestors and&#xA;fulfilled all my desires in that respect.&#xA;Bereaved Gandhari, laying aside her own&#xA;grief, has ministered to my physical wants&#xA;all these years. My cruel sons, who&#xA;committed&#xA;unforgivable&#xA;wrong&#xA;to&#xA;Draupadi and deprived you of your lawfulinheritance, perished on account of their&#xA;sins. But they fought like brave soldiers&#xA;and died in the battlefield and have gone&#xA;to the happy regions reserved for the&#xA;brave. The time has come when with&#xA;Gandhari I must do what has to be done&#xA;for our next state. You know what the&#xA;sastras have lain down. I must now go to&#xA;the forest. These robes must be replaced&#xA;by bark and tattered old clothes, suitable&#xA;for the life of Vanaprastha. I desire to go&#xA;and live in the forest, praying for your&#xA;good. I want your permission for this. Let&#xA;me follow the practice of our fathers. As&#xA;king, you will share in the fruits of my&#xA;penance.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira received a shock when he&#xA;saw Dhritarashtra and heard him say this.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I did not know,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;that you had&#xA;been fasting and sleeping on the bare&#xA;ground and mortifying your flesh in this&#xA;manner. My brothers too were unaware of&#xA;this. I was misled into believing you were&#xA;well looked after and happy. Father, you&#xA;have suffered grief, for which there can be&#xA;no solace. I see no good in kingdom or&#xA;pleasures. I am a sinner. Desire and&#xA;ambition deceived me into this. Let your&#xA;son Yuyutsu be king, or anyone else you&#xA;choose. Or if you will do so, you yourself&#xA;may take up the duties of king and look&#xA;after the people. I shall go to the forest.&#xA;Let me terminate this chapter of error. I&#xA;implore you to save me from further&#xA;obloquy and burning shame. I am not the&#xA;king. You are the king. You ask me for&#xA;permission to go. How then can I give or&#xA;refuse permission to you? Let me assure&#xA;you that my anger against Duryodhana is&#xA;a thing of the past, gone without a trace.&#xA;Fate willed it and engulfed us all in&#xA;confusion of mind. And events happened&#xA;which were not in our control. We are&#xA;your children, even like Duryodhana and&#xA;his brothers. Gandhari and Kunti is alike&#xA;mother to me and command equal regard&#xA;and filial affection from me, their child. If&#xA;you go away to the forest, I must go with&#xA;you and serve you there. If you retire to&#xA;the woods and leave me here, what joy&#xA;shall I have in kingship? I prostrate myself&#xA;before you and implore you to forgive the&#xA;errors we have been guilty of. Serving you&#xA;will give me true joy and peace of mind.&#xA;Give me that opportunity and privilege.&#xA;Do not desert me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhritarashtra was deeply moved. But he&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Kunti&amp;rsquo;s beloved son, my mind is&#xA;fixed on going to the forest and on&#xA;penance. I can find no peace otherwise&#xA;now. I have lived under your roof for&#xA;many years. You and all your people have&#xA;served me with unstinted devotion. You&#xA;must permit me now to fulfil my wish and&#xA;let me go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having thus spoken to Yudhishthira, who&#xA;stood with clasped hands and trembling&#xA;with agitation, Dhritarashtra turned to&#xA;Vidura and Kripacharya: &amp;ldquo;I beg of you to&#xA;comfort the king and make him grant my&#xA;prayer. My mind is fixed on the forest. I&#xA;am unable to speak any more. I am feeling&#xA;dry in my throat. Perhaps, it is due to age.&#xA;I have talked too much. I am tired.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying this, he leaned helplessly on&#xA;Gandhari and swooned.&#xA;Yudhishthira was unable to bear this&#xA;distress of the grand old man, who had&#xA;possessed the sinews of an elephant and&#xA;had had strength enough to crush the&#xA;metal figure of Bhima into powder.&#xA;How lean he had become now and&#xA;emaciated, with his bones showing&#xA;through his skin, piteously leaning&#xA;senseless on Gandhari like one destitute.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Have I caused all this?&amp;rdquo; he reproached&#xA;himself. &amp;ldquo;Miserable and unworthy am I,&#xA;ignorant&#xA;of&#xA;dharma,&#xA;devoid&#xA;of&#xA;intelligence. A curse on my learning!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He sprinkled water on Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s face&#xA;and caressingly stroked him with his soft&#xA;hands.When the old man recovered, he tenderly&#xA;clasped the Pandava to his bosom and&#xA;muttered: &amp;ldquo;My dear boy, how sweet is&#xA;your touch! I am happy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Vyasa entered. When he was&#xA;acquainted with what had happened, he&#xA;said to Yudhishthira:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do what Dhritarashtra, eldest of the&#xA;Kurus, desires. Let him go to the forest.&#xA;He is old. All his sons have gone before&#xA;him. It is not possible for him much&#xA;longer to bear his grief. Gandhari, whom&#xA;God has blessed with enlightenment, has&#xA;borne her sorrows with courage. Do not&#xA;stand in the way of their wishes. Let not&#xA;Dhritarashtra pine away and die here. Let&#xA;him go and live among the honeyladen&#xA;flowers of the forest and breathe their&#xA;fragrance, leaving the cares of the world&#xA;behind. The dharma of kings is to die in&#xA;battle or to spend their last days in&#xA;retirement in the forest. Dhritarashtra has&#xA;ruled the kingdom and performed yajnas.&#xA;When you were in the wilderness for&#xA;thirteen years, he enjoyed the wide earth&#xA;through his son and gave bounteous gifts.&#xA;You left him nothing to desire. The time&#xA;has come for him to do penance. Let him&#xA;go with your hearty consent, and without&#xA;anger in his heart.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dharmaraja said: &amp;ldquo;So be it!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Vyasa returned to his hermitage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>104 THE PASSING AWAY OF THE THREE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN Yudhishthira at last gave his&#xA;consent for Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s retirement to&#xA;the forest, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari&#xA;went back to their residence and broke&#xA;their fast.&#xA;Kunti sat with Gandhari and they ate&#xA;together. Dhritarashtra asked Yudhishthira&#xA;to sit by him and gave him his last&#xA;blessings.&#xA;Then the old man stepped out and, with&#xA;his hand resting on Gandhari&amp;rsquo;s shoulder,&#xA;slowly walked out of the city on his&#xA;journey to the forest.&#xA;Gandhari, who, because her lord and&#xA;husband was blind, gave up the use of her&#xA;eyes and wrapped her face with a cloth all&#xA;her life, placed her hand on Kunti&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;shoulder and slowly walked along, thus&#xA;guided.&#xA;Kunti had decided in her mind to go with&#xA;Gandhari to the forest. As she walked on,&#xA;she was speaking to Yudhishthira: &amp;ldquo;Son,&#xA;do not ever let your speech be angry when&#xA;you speak to Sahadeva. Remember with&#xA;love Karna who died a hero&amp;rsquo;s death on the&#xA;battlefield. He was my son, but I&#xA;committed the crime of not disclosing it to&#xA;you. Look after Draupadi with unfailing&#xA;tenderness. Do not ever give cause for&#xA;grief to Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and&#xA;Sahadeva. Keep this ever in mind, son.&#xA;The burden of the family is now wholly&#xA;on you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dharmaputra had till then believed that&#xA;Kunti was accompanying Gandhari only&#xA;for a distance to say goodbye. When he&#xA;heard her speak thus, he was taken aback&#xA;and was speechless for a few minutes.&#xA;When he recovered from the shock he&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Mother, not thus! You blessed us&#xA;and sent us to battle. It is not right you&#xA;should now desert us and go to the forest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s entreaties were however of&#xA;no avail. Kunti held to her purpose.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I must join my lord and husband&#xA;wherever he be now. I shall be with&#xA;Gandhari and go through the discipline of&#xA;forest life and soon join your father. Go&#xA;back unagitated. Return to the city. May&#xA;your mind ever stand steady on dharma.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus did Kunti bless her illustrious son&#xA;and depart.&#xA;Yudhishthira stood speechless. Kunti went&#xA;on her way, looking back occasionally at&#xA;him and her other sons.&#xA;Each with hand on the shoulder of the&#xA;other, this picture of the three elders of thetribe wending their way to the forest,&#xA;leaving their sons behind, is painted by&#xA;the poet so vividly that it fills the reader&#xA;with solemn grief, as if the parting&#xA;happened in his own family now.&#xA;Dhritarashtra, Gandhari and Kunti spent&#xA;three years in the forest. Sanjaya was with&#xA;them. When one day, Dhritarashtra&#xA;finished his ablutions and returned to their&#xA;hermitage, the forest had caught fire.&#xA;The wind blew and the flames spread&#xA;everywhere. The deer and the wild boars&#xA;ran in herds hither and thither, and rushed&#xA;madly to the pools.&#xA;Dhritarashtra told Sanjaya: &amp;ldquo;This fire will&#xA;envelop us all. You had better save&#xA;yourself.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying this, the blind old king, Gandhari&#xA;with her eves blindfolded and Kunti sat&#xA;down on the ground, the three of them,&#xA;facing eastwards in yoga posture and&#xA;calmly gave themselves up to the flames.&#xA;Sanjaya, who had been to the blind king,&#xA;throughout all his days, his only light and&#xA;was dear to him like life itself, spent the&#xA;rest of his days in the Himalayas as a&#xA;sanyasin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;KRISHNA ruled at Dwaraka for thirty-six&#xA;years after the Kurukshetra battle was&#xA;over. The Vrishnis, the Bhopas and other&#xA;branches of the Yadavas belonging to&#xA;Krishna&amp;rsquo;s tribe spent their days in&#xA;unrestrained self-indulgence and luxury.&#xA;They lost all sense of discipline and&#xA;humility.&#xA;Once, some rishis came to Dwaraka. The&#xA;arrogant and irreverent Yadavas mocked&#xA;these rishis with a practical joke. They&#xA;dressed up one of their young men like a&#xA;woman and, presenting him to the revered&#xA;guests, said: &amp;ldquo;O ye learned men, tell us&#xA;whether this lady will have a boy or a&#xA;girl.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The rishis saw through the irreverent joke&#xA;and said in anger: &amp;ldquo;This person will give&#xA;birth to a mace, not a boy or a girl and that&#xA;mace will prove to be Yama to your tribe&#xA;and destroy you all.&amp;rdquo; The rishis departed&#xA;after pronouncing this curse.&#xA;The foolish Yadavas were rather&#xA;perturbed at this unpleasant ending of&#xA;what they had thought was a good joke.&#xA;Next day, they were in consternation to&#xA;see that Samba, the man who had been&#xA;dressed up in female clothes, developed&#xA;labor pains and lo and behold, gave birth&#xA;to a mace! This filled them with terror&#xA;because they felt that their end was near&#xA;as the rishis had cursed.&#xA;They deliberated long and finally ground&#xA;the mace to fine powder, which they&#xA;scattered in the sea, and thought they, had&#xA;thus disposed of the danger.&#xA;Nothing happened for some time. Seasons&#xA;passed. The rains came and on the beach,&#xA;near where they had strewn the fine dust&#xA;of the awful club, there sprang up a dense,&#xA;crop of rushes.&#xA;When the Yadavas saw this, they were&#xA;curious and amused, for they had&#xA;forgotten all about the curse of the revered&#xA;guests.&#xA;One day, long after, the Yadavas went to&#xA;the beach for a picnic and spent the whole&#xA;day in dance and drink and revelry. The&#xA;liquor began to work.&#xA;At first merry, then pugnacious, they&#xA;began to talk without restrain, raking up&#xA;old offences and quarrelling, on slight&#xA;cause with one another. Among the&#xA;Yadavas, Kritavarma had fought on the&#xA;side of the Kauravas and Satyaki on that&#xA;of the Pandavas.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Would any Kshatriya attack and kill&#xA;sleeping soldiers, O Kritavarma? You&#xA;have brought a great and lasting disgrace&#xA;on our tribe,&amp;rdquo; said Satyaki, taunting&#xA;Kritavarma, and a number of drunken&#xA;Yadavas applauded the attack. Kritavarma&#xA;could not bear the insult.&amp;ldquo;Like a butcher, you slaughtered the great&#xA;Bhurisravas when seated in yoga after his&#xA;right hand was cut off and you, coward,&#xA;dare to taunt me,&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed and a&#xA;number of the revelers joined him and&#xA;began to scoff at Satyaki for his barbarous&#xA;deed.&#xA;Soon, all the Yadavas were in the quarrel&#xA;on one side or the other and presently&#xA;from words they came to blows, which&#xA;swiftly developed into a free fight.&#xA;Satyaki, with his sword drawn, sprang&#xA;upon Kritavarma and cut his head off,&#xA;exclaiming: &amp;ldquo;Here is the end of the&#xA;coward who killed sleeping soldiers! &amp;quot;&#xA;Others immediately fell upon Satyaki with&#xA;their drinking bowls and pots and&#xA;anything they could lay hands upon.&#xA;Pradyumna, Krishna&amp;rsquo;s son, joined the fray&#xA;to rescue Satyaki and there was a&#xA;desperate melee in which both Satyaki&#xA;and Pradyumna were killed.&#xA;Krishna knew that the destined hour was&#xA;come, and plucking the tall rushes, which&#xA;fringed the beach, laid about him with&#xA;them indiscriminately.&#xA;This led to every one of the Yadavas&#xA;doing the same and there was great&#xA;indiscriminate slaughter. The rishis&amp;rsquo; curse&#xA;had begun to work.&#xA;The rushes that had grown out of the mace&#xA;became each one of them a mace as it was&#xA;plucked by the doomed men in their&#xA;unreasonable fury. They used them on one&#xA;another with deadly effect and soon all of&#xA;them were destroyed in this drunken&#xA;brawl.&#xA;Balarama, who was seeing all this, was&#xA;overwhelmed with shame and disgust and&#xA;sank to the ground. He gave up his life as&#xA;he lay in a yoga trance. Balarama passed&#xA;away into the ocean in a stream of light,&#xA;which issued from his forehead like a&#xA;silver serpent. Thus ended the avatar of&#xA;Narayana in Balarama.&#xA;Krishna saw all his people thus destroy&#xA;themselves as predestined. When he saw&#xA;the passing of Balarama, he roamed about&#xA;in deep meditation in the wilderness,&#xA;pondering on the completion of his avatar.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The time has come for me to go,&amp;rdquo; he said&#xA;to himself and, lying on the ground fell&#xA;asleep.&#xA;In that wooded beach, a hunter, prowling&#xA;for game, saw Vasudeva lying on the&#xA;ground among the shrubs. From a&#xA;distance, the hunter mistook Krishna for a&#xA;wild animal resting on the ground.&#xA;He bent his bow and shot an arrow at the&#xA;prostrate figure which, piercing his foot in&#xA;the insteep, went full through his body.&#xA;Thus did the great Vasudeva depart from&#xA;the world of men.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To Hastinapura came the sad tidings of&#xA;the death of Vasudeva and the destruction&#xA;of the Yadavas. When the Pandavas&#xA;received the news, they lost all remaining&#xA;attachment to life on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They&#xA;crowned&#xA;Parikshit,&#xA;son&#xA;of Abhimanyu, as emperor and the five&#xA;brothers left the city with Draupadi. They&#xA;went out on a pilgrimage, visiting holy&#xA;places and finally reached the Himalayas.&#xA;A dog joined them somewhere and kept&#xA;them company all along. And the seven of&#xA;them climbed the mountain on their last&#xA;pilgrimage. As they toiled up the&#xA;mountain path one by one fell exhausted&#xA;and died.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
