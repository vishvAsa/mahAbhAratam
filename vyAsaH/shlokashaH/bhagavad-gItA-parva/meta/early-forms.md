The Vepacittisutta was also composed in response to an early version of the Gītā (the "triṣṭubh" hymn), with Mātali representing Kṛṣṇa and Indra representing Arjuna. 

The author of the Vepacitti Sutta of Saṃyuttanikāya must've been familiar with an early form of the Gītā.
He must've been aware of "bhayād raṇād uparataṁ mansyante tvām..." and "kṣudram hṛdaya-daurbalyam tyaktvottiṣṭha parantapa" as he puts the similar words into the mouth of Indra's sārathi Mātali "bhayā nu Maghavā Sakka, dubbalyā no titikkhasi" and then proceeds to reply to it.
In the Mbh. narrative, Kṛṣṇa is the sārathi of Arjuna, who is closely linked with Indra.

Arjuna and Indra? Or Vepacitti Sutta and Gita?
Lawrence W. Faucett discusses it in "The Charioteer and the God."  
Kashi Nath Upadhyay and Richard V. De Smet assume that the Gita is borrowing Vepacitti Sutta, though it makes no sense to assume Gita would borrow from a losing argument. It's more reasonable to assume that Vepacitti Sutta is responding to Gita than vice versa.
