10.12 - 10.13 Arjuna said You are Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Light,
and the Supreme Sanctifier. All the seers proclaim You as the eternal,
divine Person, the Primal Lord, the unborn and all-pervading. So also proclaim the divine sages Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa. You Yourself also proclaim this.
