11.37 And why should they not, O great Soul, bow to Thee Who art greater
(than all else), the primal cause even of the Creator (Brahma), O Infinite Being, O Lord of the gods, O Abode of the universe; Thou art the imperishable, the Being, the non-being and That which is the supreme
(that which is beyond the Being and the non-being).
