5.19 इह here; एव even; तैः by them; जितः is conered; सर्गः rirth or creation; येषाम् of whom; साम्ये in eality; स्थितम् established; मनः
mind; निर्दोषम् spotless; हि indeed; समम् eal; ब्रह्म Brahman; तस्मात्
therefore; ब्रह्मणि in Brahman; ते they; स्थिताः are established.Commentary When the mind gets rooted in eanimity or evenness or eality; when it is always in a balanced state; one coners birth and death. Bondage is annihilated and freedom is attained by him. When the mind is in a perfectly balanced state he overcomes Brahman Himself;
i.e.; realises Brahman.Brahman is ever pure and attributeless and so He is not affected even though He dwells in an outcaste; dog; etc. So He is spotless. He is homogeneous and one; as He dwells eally in all beings.
