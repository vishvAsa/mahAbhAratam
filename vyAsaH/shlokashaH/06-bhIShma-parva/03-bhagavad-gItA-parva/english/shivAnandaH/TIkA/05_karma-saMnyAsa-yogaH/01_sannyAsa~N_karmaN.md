5.1 संन्यासम् renunciation; कर्मणाम् of actions; कृष्ण O Krishna; पुनः
again; योगम् Yoga; च and; शंससि (Thou) praisest; यत् which; श्रेयः
better; एतयोः of these two; एकम् one; तत् that; मे to me; ब्रूहि tell;
सुनिश्चितम् conclusively.Commentary Thou teachest renunciation of actions and also their performance. This has confused me. Tell decisively now which is better. It is not possible for a man to resort to both of them at the same time. Yoga here means Karma Yoga. (Cf.III.2)
