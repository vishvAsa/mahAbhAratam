5.4 साङ्ख्ययोगौ Sankhya (knowledge) and Yoga (Yoga of action or performance of action); पृथक् distinct; बालाः children; प्रवदन्ति speak;
न not; पण्डिताः the wise; एकम् one; अपि even; आस्थितः established in;
सम्यक् truly; उभयोः of both; विन्दते obtains; फलम् fruit.Commentary Children the ignorant people who have no knowledge of the Self; and who have only a theoretical knowledge of the scriptures.Children or ignorant people only say that knowledge and the performance of action are different and produce distinct and opposite results. But the wise who have the knowledge of the Self say that they produce the same result only; viz.; Moksha or liberation. He who is duly established in,one; he who truly lives in one; Sankhya or Yoga; obtains the fruits of both.
Therefore there is no diversity in the result or the fruit. This is the gist of this verse. (Cf.VI.2)
