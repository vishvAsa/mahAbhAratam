5.22 ये which; हि verily; संस्पर्शजाः contactborn; भोगाः enjoyments;
दुःखयोनयः generators of pain; एव only; ते they; आद्यन्तवन्तः having beginning and end; कौन्तेय O Kaunteya; न not; तेषु in those; रमते
rejoices; बुधः the wise.Commentary Man goes in est of joy and searches in the external perishable objects for his happiness. He fails to get it but instead he carries a load of sorrow on his head.You should withdraw the senses from the senseobjects as there is no trace of happiness in them and fix the min on the immortal; blissful Self within. The senseobjects have a beginning and an end. Separation from the senseobjects gives you a lot of pain. During the interval between the origin and the end you experience a hollow; momentary; illusory pleasure. This fleeting pleasure is due to Avidya or ignorance. Even in the other world you will have the same experience. He who is endowed with discrimination or the knowledge of the Self will never rejoice in these sensual objects. Only ignorant persons who are passionate will rejoice in the senseobjects. (Cf.II.14;XVIII.38)
