(1) Nitya Karmas These are obligatory duties. Their performance does not produce any merit but their nonperformance produces demerit.
Sandhyavandana; etc.; belong to this category.(2) Naimittika Karmas These Karmas are performed on the occurrence of some special events such as the birth of a son; eclipse; etc.(3) Kamya Karmas These are optional.
They are intended for the attainment of some special ends (for getting rain; son; etc.)(4) Nishiddha Karmas These are forbidden actions such as theft; drinking liour; etc.(5) Prayaschitta Karmas Actions performed to neutralise the effects of evil actions or sins.The man who has controlled the senses renounces all actions by discrimination; by seeing inaction in action and rests happily in this body of nine openings (the ninegated city); because he is free from cares; worries; anxieties and fear and his mind is ite calm and he enjoys the supreme peace of the Eternal. In this ninegated city the Self is the king. The senses; the mind; the subconscious mind; and the intellect are the inhabitants or subjects.The ignorant wordly man says; I am resting in the easychair.
The man of wisdom who has realised that the Self is distinct from the body which is a product of the five elements; says; I am resting in this body. (Cf.XVIII.17;50)
