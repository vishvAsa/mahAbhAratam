5.29 भोक्तारम् the enjoyer; यज्ञतपसाम् of sacrifices and austerities;
सर्वलोकमहेश्वरम् the great Lord of all worlds; सुहृदम् friend;
सर्वभूतानाम् of all beings; ज्ञात्वा having known; माम् Me; शान्तिम्
peace; ऋच्छति attains.Commentary I am the Lord of all sacrifices and austerities. I am their author; goal and their God. I am the friend of all beings; the doer of good to them without expecting any return for it. I am the dispenser of the fruits of all actions and the silent witness of their minds; thoughts and actions as I dwell in their hearts.
On knowing Me; they attain peace and liberation or Moksha (deliverance from the round of birth and death and all worldly miseries and sorrows).
(Cf.V.15IX.24)Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita; the science of the Eternal; the scripture of Yoga; the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna; ends the fifth discourse entitledThe Yoga of Renunciation of Action.
