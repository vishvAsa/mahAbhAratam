5.17 तद्बुद्धयः intellect absorbed in That; तदात्मानः their self being That; तन्निष्ठाः established in That; तत्परायणाः with That for their supreme goal; गच्छन्ति go; अपुनरावृत्तिम् not again returning;
ज्ञाननिर्धूतकल्मषाः,those whose sins have been dispelled by knowledge.Commentary They fix their intellects on Brahman or the Supreme Self. They feel and realise that Brahman is their self. By constant and protracted meditation; they get established in Brahman. The whole world of names and forms vanishes for them. They live in Brahman alone. They have Brahman alone as their supreme goal or sole refuge. They rejoice in the Self alone. They are satisfied in the Self alone. They are contented in the Self alone. Such men never come back to this Samsara; as their sins are dispelled by knowledge (BrahmaJnana). (Cf.IX.34)
