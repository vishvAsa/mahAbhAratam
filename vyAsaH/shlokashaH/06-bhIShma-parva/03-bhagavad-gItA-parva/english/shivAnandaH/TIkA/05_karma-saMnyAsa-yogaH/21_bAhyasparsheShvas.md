5.21 बाह्यस्पर्शेषु in external contacts; असक्तात्मा one whose mind is unattached; विन्दति finds; आत्मनि in,the Self; यत् (that) which; सुखम्
happiness; सः he; ब्रह्मयोगयुक्तात्मा with the self engaged in the meditation of Brahman; सुखम् happiness; अक्षयम् endless; अश्नुते
enjoys.Commentary When the mind is not attached to external objects of the senses; when one is deeply engaged in the contemplation of Brahman;
he finds undecaying bliss in the Self within. If you want to enjoy the imperishable happiness of the Self within; you will have to withdraw the senses from their respective objects and plunge yourself in deep meditation on the Self within. This is the gist of this verse.
