5.26 कामक्रोधवियुक्तानाम् of those who are free from desire and anger;
यतीनाम् of the selfcontrolled ascetics; यतचेतसाम् of those who have controlled their thoughts; अभितः on all sides; ब्रह्मनिर्वाणम् absolute freedom; वर्तते exists; विदितात्मनाम् of those who have realised the Self.Commentary Those who renounce all actions and practise Sravana
(hearing of the scriptures); Manana (reflection) and Nididhyasana
(meditation); who are established in Brahman or who are steadily devoted to the knowledge of the Self attain liberation or Moksha instantaneously
(Kaivalya Moksha). Karma Yoga leads to Moksha step by step (Krama Mukti). First comes purification of the mind; then knowledge; then renunciation of all actions and eventually Moksha.
