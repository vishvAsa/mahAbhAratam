5.2 संन्यासः renunciation; कर्मयोगः Yoga of action; च and; निःश्रेयसकरौ
leading to the highest bliss; उभौ both; तयोः of these two; तु but;
कर्मसंन्यासात् than renunciation of action; कर्मयोगः Yoga of action;
विशिष्यते is superior.Commentary Sannyasa (renunciation of action) and Karma Yoga (performance of action) both lead to Moksha or liberation or the highest bliss. Though both lead to Moksha; yet of the two means of attaining to Moksha; Karma Yoga is better than mere Karma Sannyasa
(renunciation of action) without the knowledge of the Self.But renunciation of actions with the knowledge of the Self is decidedly superior to Karma Yoga.Moreover; Karma Yoga is easy and is therefore suitable to all. (Cf.III.3V.5VI.46)
