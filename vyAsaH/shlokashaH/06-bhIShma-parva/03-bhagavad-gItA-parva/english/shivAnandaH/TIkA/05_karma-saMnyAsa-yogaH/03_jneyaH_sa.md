5.3 ज्ञेयः should be known; सः he; नित्यसंन्यासी perpetual ascetic; यः
who; न not; द्वेष्टि hates; न not; काङ्क्षति desires; निर्द्वन्द्वः one free from the pairs of opposites; हि verily; महाबाहो O mightyarmed;
सुखम् easily; बन्धात् from bondage; प्रमुच्यते is set free.Commentary A man does not become a Sannyasi by merely giving up actions because of laziness or ignorance or some family arrel or calamity or unemployment.
A true Sannyasi is not a hypocritical coward.The Karma Yogi who neither hates pain and the objects which give him pain; nor desires pleasure and the objects that give him pleasure; who has neither attachment nor aversion to any senseobject and who has risen above the pairs of heat and cold; joy and sorrow; success and failure; victory and defeat; gain and loss; praise and censure; honour and dishonour; should be known as a perpetual Sannyasi though he is ever engaged in action.One need not have taken Sannyasa formally but if he has the above mental attitutde; he is a perpetual Sannyasi. Mere ochrecoloured robe cannot make one a Sannyasi. What is wanted is a pure heart with true renunciation of egoism and desires. Physical renunciation of objects is no renunciation at all. (Cf.VI.1)
