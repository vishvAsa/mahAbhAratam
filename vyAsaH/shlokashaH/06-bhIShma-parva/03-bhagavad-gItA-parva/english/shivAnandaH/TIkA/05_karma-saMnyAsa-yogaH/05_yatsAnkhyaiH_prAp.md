5.5 यत् which; साङ्ख्यैः by the Sankhyas; प्राप्यते is reached; स्थानम्
place; तत् that; योगैः by the Yogis (Karma Yogis); अपि also; गम्यते is reached; एकम् one; साङ्ख्यम् the Sankhya (knowledge); च and; योगम् Yoga
(performance of action); च and; यः who; पश्यति sees; सः he; पश्यति
sees.Commentary Those who have renounced the world and are treading the path of Jnana Yoga or Vedanta are the Sankhyas. Through Sravana (hearing of the Srutis or Vedantic texts); Manana (reflection on what is heard)
and Nididhyasana (constant and profound meditation) they attain to Moksha or Kaivalya directly. Karma Yogis who do selfless service; who perform their duties without expectation of the fruits and who dedicate their actions as offerings unto the Lord also reach the same state as is attained by Sankhyas indirectly through the purification of their heart and renunciation and the conseent dawn of the knowledge of the Self.
That man who sees that Sankhya and Yoga are one; as leading to the same result; sees rightly. (Cf.XIII.24;25V.2)
