3.12 इष्टान् desired; भोगान् objects; हि so; वः to you; देवाः the gods;
दास्यन्ते will give; यज्ञभाविताः nourished by sacrifice; तैः by them;
दत्तान् give; अप्रदाय without offering; एभ्यः to them; यः who; भुङ्क्ते
enjoys; स्तेनः thief; एव verily; सः he.Commentary When the gods are pleased with you sacrifices; they will bestow on you all the desired objects such as children; cattle; property; etc. He who enjoys what has been given to him by the gods; i.e.; he who gratifies the cravings of his own body and the senses without offering anything to the gods in return is a veritable thief. He is really a dacoit of the property of the gods.
