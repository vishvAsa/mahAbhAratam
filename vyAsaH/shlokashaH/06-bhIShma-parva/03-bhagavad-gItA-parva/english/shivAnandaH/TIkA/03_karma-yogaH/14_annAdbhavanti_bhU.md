3.14 अन्नात् from food; भवन्ति come forth; भूतानि beings; पर्जन्यात्
from rain; अन्नसम्भवः production of food; यज्ञात् from sacrifice; भवति
arises; पर्जन्यः rain; यज्ञः sacrifice; कर्मसमुद्भवः born of action.Commentary Here Yajna means Apurva or the subtle principle or the unseen form which a sacrifice assumes between the time of its performance and the time when its fruits manifest themselves.
