3.42 इन्द्रियाणि the senses; पराणि superior; आहुः (they) say;
इन्द्रियेभ्यः than the senses; परम् superior; मनः the mind; मनसः than the mind; तु but; परा superior; बुद्धिः intellect; यः who; बुद्धेः than the intellect; परतः greater; तु but; सः He.Commentary When compared with the physical body which is gross; external and limited; the senses are certainly superior as they are more subtle; internal and have a wider range of activity. The mind is superior to the senses; as the senses cannot do anything independently without the help of the mind. The mind can perform the functions of the five senses. The intellect is superior to the mind because it is endowed with the faculty of discrimination.
When the mind is in a state of doubt; the intellect comes to its resuce.
The Self; the Witness; is superior even to the intellect; as the intellect borrows its light from the Self.
