3.28 तत्त्ववित् the knower of the Truth; तु but; महाबाहो O mightyarmed;
गुणकर्मविभागयोः of the divisions of alities and functions; गुणाः the alities (in the shape of senses); गुणेषु amidst the alities (in the shape of objects); वर्तन्ते remain; इति thus; मत्वा knowing; न not;
सज्जते is attached.Commentary He who knows the truth that the Self is entirely distinct from the three Gunas and actions does not become attached to the actions. He who knows the truth about the classification of the Gunas and their respective functions understands that the alities as senseorgans move amidst the alities as senseobjects. Therefore he is not attached to the actions. He knows; I am Akarta -- I am not the doer.
(Cf.XIV.23).
