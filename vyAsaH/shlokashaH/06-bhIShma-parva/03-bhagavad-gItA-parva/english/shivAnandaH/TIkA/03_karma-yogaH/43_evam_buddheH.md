of the form of desire; दुरासदम् hard to coner.Commentary Restrain the lower self by the higher Self. Subdue the lower mind by the higher mind.
It is difficult to coner desire because it is of a highly complex and incomprehensible nature. But a man of discrimination and dispassion who does constant and intense Sadhana can coner it ite easily. Desire is the ality of Rajas. If you increase the Sattvic ality in you; you can coner desire. Rajas cannot stand before Sattva.Even though desire is hard to coner; it is not impossible. The simple and direct method is to appeal to the Indwelling Presence (God) through prayer and Japa.Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita; the science of the Eternal;
the scripture of Yoga; the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna; ends the third discourse entitledThe Yoga of Action.
