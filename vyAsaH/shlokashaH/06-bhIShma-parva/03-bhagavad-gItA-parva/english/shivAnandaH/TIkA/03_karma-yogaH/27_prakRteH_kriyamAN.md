3.27 प्रकृतेः of nature; क्रियमाणानि are performed; गुणैः by the alities; कर्माणि actions; सर्वशः in all cases; अहङ्कारविमूढात्मा one whose mind is deluded by egosim; कर्ता doer; अहम् I; इति thus; मन्यते
thinks.Commentary Prakriti or Pradhana or Nature is that state in which the three Gunas; viz.; Sattva; Rajas and Tamas exist in a state of eilibrium. When this eilibrium is disturbed; creation begins body;
senses; mind; etc.; are formed. The man who is deluded by egoism identifies the Self with the body; mind; the life force and the senses and ascribes to the Self all the attributes of the body and the senses.
He; therefore; thinks through ignorance; I am the doer. In reality the Gunas of Nature perform all actions.
