3.9 यज्ञार्थात् for the sake of sacrifice; कर्मणः of action; अन्यत्र
otherwise; लोकः the world; अयम् this; कर्मबन्धनः bound by action;
तदर्थम् for that sake; कर्म action; कौन्तेय O Kaunteya; मुक्तसंगः free from attachment; समाचार perform.Commentary Yajna means sacrifice or religious rite or any unselfish action done with a pure motive. It means also Isvara. The Taittiriya Samhita (of the Veda) says Yajna verily is Vishnu (174). If anyone does actions for the sake of the Lord; he is not bound. His heart is purified by performing actions for the sake of the Lord. Where this spirit of unselfishness does not govern the action; it will bind one to Samsara however good or glorious it may be. (Cf.II.48).
