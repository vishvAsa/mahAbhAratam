3.6 कर्मेन्द्रियाणि organs of action; संयम्य restraining; यः who; आस्ते
sits; मनसा by the mind; स्मरन् remembering; इन्द्रियार्थान्
senseobjects; विमूढात्मा of deluded understanding; मिथ्याचारः hypocrite;
सः he; उच्यते is called.Commentary The five organs of action; Karma Indriyas; are Vak (organ of speech); Pani (hands); Padam (feet); Upastha
(genitals) and Guda (anus). They are born of the Rajasic portion of the five Tanmatras or subtle elements Vak from the Akasa Tanmatra (ether);
Pani from the Vayu Tanmatra (air); Padam from the Agni Tanmatra (fire);
Upastha from the Apas Tanmatra (water); and Guda from the Prithivi Tanmatra (earth). That man who; restraining the organs of action; sits revolving in his mind thoughts regarding the objects of the senses is a man of sinful conduct. He is selfdeluded. He is a veritable hypocrite.The organs of action must be controlled. The thoughts should also be controlled. The mind should be firmly fixed on the Lord. Only then will you become a true Yogi. Only then will you attain to Selfrealisation.
