3.25 सक्ताः attached; कर्मणि to action; अविद्वांसः the ignorant; यथा as;
कुर्वन्ति act; भारत O Bharata; कुर्यात् should act; विद्वान् the wise;
तथा so; असक्तः unattached; चिकीर्षुः wishing; लोकसंग्रहम् the welfare of the world.Commentary The ignorant man works in expectation of fruits. He says; I will do such and such work and will get such and such fruit. But the wise man who knows the Self; serves not for his own end. He should so act that the world; following his example; would attain peace;
harmony; purity of heart; divine light and knowledge. A wise man is one who knows the Self. (Cf.II.64III.19XVIII.49).
