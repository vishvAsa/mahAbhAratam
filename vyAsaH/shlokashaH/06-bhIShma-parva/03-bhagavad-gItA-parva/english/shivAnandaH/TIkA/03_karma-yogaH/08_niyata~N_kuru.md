action; त्वम् thou; कर्म action; ज्यायः superior; हि for; अकर्मणः than inaction; शरीरयात्रा maintenance of the body; अपि even; च and; ते thy; न
not; प्रसिद्ध्येत् would be possible; अकर्मणः by inaction.Commentary Niyatam Karma is an obligatory duty which one is bound to perform. The  
  
nonperformance of the bounden duties causes demerit. The performance of the obligatory duties is not a means for the attainment of a specific result. The performance does not cause any merit.Living itself involves several natural and unavoidable actions which have to be performed by all. It is ignorance to say; I can live doing nothing.
