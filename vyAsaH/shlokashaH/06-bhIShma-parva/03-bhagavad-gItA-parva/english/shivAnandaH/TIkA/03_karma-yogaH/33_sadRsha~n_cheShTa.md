3.33 सदृशम् in accordance; चेष्टते acts; स्वस्याः of his own; प्रकृतेः
of nature; ज्ञानवान् a wise man; अपि even; प्रकृतिम् to nature; यान्ति
follow; भूतानि beings; निग्रहः restraint; किम् what; करिष्यति will do.Commentary He who reads this verse will come to the conclusion that there is no scope for mans personal exertion. It is not so. Read the following verse. It clearly indicates that man can coner Nature if he rises above the sway of RagaDvesha (love and hatred).The passionate and ignorant man only comes under the sway of his natural propensities; and his lower nature. He cannot have any restraint over the senses and the two currents of likes and dislikes. The seeker after Truth who is endowed with the four means; and who is constantly practising meditation can easily control Nature. (Cf.II.60V.14XVIII.59).
