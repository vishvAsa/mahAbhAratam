3.26 न not; बुद्धिभेदम् unsettlement in the mind; जनयेत् should produce;
अज्ञानाम् of the ignorant; कर्मसङ्गिनाम् of the persons attached to actions; जोषयेत् should engage; सर्वकर्माणि all actions; विद्वान् the wise; युक्तः balanced; समाचरन् performing.Commentary An ignorant may says to himelf; I shall do this action and thery enjoy its fruit. A wise man should not unsettle his belief. On the contrary he himself should set an example by performing his duties diligently but without attachment. The wise man should also persuade the ignorant never to neglect their duties. If need be; he should place before them in vivid colours the happiness they would enjoy here and hereafter by discharging such duties. When their hearts get purified in course of time; the wise man could sow the seeds of Karma Yoga (selfless service without deire)
in them.
