6.21 सुखम् bliss; आत्यन्तिकम् infinite; यत् which; तत् that;
बुद्धिग्राह्यम् that which can be grasped by reason; अतीन्द्रियम्
transcending the senses; वेत्ति knows; यत्र where; न not; च and; एव
even; अयम् this; स्थितः established; चलति moves; तत्त्वतः from the Reality.Commentary The Infinite Bliss of the Self (which is beyond the reach of the senses) can be grasped (realised) by the pure intellect independently of the senses. During deep meditation the senses cease to function; as they are involved into their cause; the mind. The intellect is rendered pure by the practice of Yama (selfrestriant) and Niyama
(observances and disciplinary practices) and constant meditation.
