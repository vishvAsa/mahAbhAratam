enjoys.Commentary By Yogic practices such as the withdrawal of the senses; concentration and meditation he loses contact with the objects of the senses and comes into contact with Brahman or the immortal Self within and thus enjoys the Infinite Bliss of Brahman.Sensual pleasures are transitory or fleeting but the bliss of Brahman is uninterrupted;
undecaying and everlasting. That is the reason why one should attempt to realise the Self within.The Yogi removes the obstacles that stand in the way of obtaining union with the Lord and thus always keeps the mind steady in the Self.
