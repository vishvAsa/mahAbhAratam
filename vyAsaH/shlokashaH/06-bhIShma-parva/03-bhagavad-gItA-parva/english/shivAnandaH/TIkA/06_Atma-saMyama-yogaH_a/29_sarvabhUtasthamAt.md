6.29 सर्वभूतस्थम् abiding in all beings; आत्मानम् the Self; सर्वभूतानि
all beings; च and; आत्मनि in the Self;,ईक्षते sees; योगयुक्तात्मा one who is harmonised by Yoga; सर्वत्र everywhere; समदर्शनः one who sees the same everywhere.Commentary The Yogi beholds through the eye of intuition
(JnanaChakshus or DivyaChakshus) oneness or unity of the Self everywhere. This is a sublime and magnanimous vision indeed. He feels;
All indeed is Brahman. He beholds that all beings are one with Brahman and that the Self and Brahman are identical.
