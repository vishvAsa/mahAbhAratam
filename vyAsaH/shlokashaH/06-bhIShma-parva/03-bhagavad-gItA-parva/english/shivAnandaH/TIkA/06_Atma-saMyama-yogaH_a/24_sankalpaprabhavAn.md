6.24 सङ्कल्पप्रभवान् born of Sankalpa (imagination); कामान् desires;
त्यक्त्वा having abandoned; सर्वान् all; अशेषतः without reserve; मनसा by the mind; एव even; इन्द्रियग्रामम् the whole group of senses; विनियम्य
completely restraining; समन्ततः from all sides.Commentary Without reserve The mind is so diplomatic that it keeps certain desires for its secret gratification. Therefore you should completely abandon all desires without reservation.Desire is born of imagination (Sankalpa).
Therefore destroy the Sankalpa first. If the imagination is annihilated first then the desires will die by themselves. Mark here All the senses must be controlled from all sides by the mind. Even if one sense is turbulent in one direction it will distract the mind often and often.
The senses will be absorbed in the mind by the constant practice of abstraction (Pratyahara). Then the mind will not think of the objects of sensepleasure and will become perfectly calm.That mind which is endowed with a strong discrimination and dispassion will be able to control the whole ground (or group) of the senses from their objects in all directions. Therefore cultivate strong Viveka or discrimination between the Real and the unreal and also Vairagya or total dispassion for sensual pleasures. (Cf.II.62)
