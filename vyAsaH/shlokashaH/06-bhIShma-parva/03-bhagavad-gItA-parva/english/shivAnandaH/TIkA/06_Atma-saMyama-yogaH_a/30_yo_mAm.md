6.30 यः who; माम् Me; पश्यति sees; सर्वत्र everywhere; सर्वम् all; च
and; मयि in Me; पश्यति sees; तस्य of him; अहम् I; न not; प्रणश्यामि
vanish; सः he; च and; मे to Me; न not; प्रणश्यति vanishes.Commentary In this verse the Lord describes the effect of the vision of the unity of the Self or oneness.He who sees Me; the Self of all; in all beings; and everything (from Brahma the Creator down to the blade of grass) in Me; I am not lost to him; nor is he lost to Me. I and the sage or seer of unity of the Self become identical or one and the same. I never leave his presence nor does he leave My presence. I never lose hold of him nor does he lose hold of Me. I dwell in him and he dwells in Me.
