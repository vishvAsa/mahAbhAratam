ideal; goal or object of meditation) is Abhyasa or practice. The same idea or thought of the Self or God is constantly repeated. This constant repetition destroys Vikshepa or the vacillation of the mind and desires;
and makes it steady and onepointed.Vairagya is dispassion or indifference to senseobjects in this world or in the other; here or hereafter; seen or unseen; heard or unheard; achieved through constantly looking into the evil in them (DoshaDrishti). You will have to train the mind by constant reflection on the immortal; allblissful Self. You must make the mind realise the transitory nature of the wordly enjoyments.
You must suggest to the mind to look for its enjoyment not in the perishable and changing external objects but in the immortal; changeless Self within. Gradually the mind will be withdrawn from the external objects.
