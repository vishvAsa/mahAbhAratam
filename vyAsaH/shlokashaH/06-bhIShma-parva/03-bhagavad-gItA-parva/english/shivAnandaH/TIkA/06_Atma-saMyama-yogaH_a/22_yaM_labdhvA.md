All the desires are fulfilled when one attains Selfrealisation. That is the reason why the Lord says There is no other acisition superior to Selfrealisation. If one gets himself established in the Supreme Self within; he cannot be shaken every by heavy sorrow and pain; because he is mindless and he is identifying himself with the sorrowless and painless Brahman. One can experience pain and sorrow when he identifies himself with the body and the mind. If there is no mind there cannot be any pain. When one is under chloroform he feels no pian even when his hand is amputated; because the mind is withdrawn from the body.
