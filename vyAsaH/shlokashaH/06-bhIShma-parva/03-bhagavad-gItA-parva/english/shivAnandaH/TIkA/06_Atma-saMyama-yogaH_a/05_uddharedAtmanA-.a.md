6.5 उद्धरेत् should raise; आत्मना by the Self; आत्मानम् the self; न not;
आत्मानम् the self; अवसादयेत् let (him) lower; आत्मा the Self; एव only;
हि verily; आत्मनः of the self; बन्धुः friend; आत्मा the Self; एव only;
रिपुः the enemy; आत्मनः of the self.Commentary Practise Yog. Discipline the senses and the mind. Elevate yourself and become a Yogarudha. Attain to Yoga. Shine gloriously as a dynamic Yogi. Do not sink into the ocean of Samsara (transmigration). Do not become a wordlyminded man. Do not become a slave of lust; greed and anger. Rise above worldliness; become divine and attain Godhead.You alone are your friend you alone are your enemy. The socalled worldly friend is not your real friend; because he gets attached to you; wastes your time and puts obstacles on your path of Yoga. He is very selfish and keeps friendship with you only to extract something. If he is not able to get from you the object of his selfish interest; he forsakes you. Therefore he is your enemy in reality. If you are attached to your friend on account of delusion or affection; this will become a cause of your bondage to Samsara.Friends and enemies are not outside. They exist in the mind only. It is the mind that makes a friend an enemy and an enemy a friend. Therefore the Self alone is the friend of oneself; and the Self alone is the enemy of oneself. The lower mind or the Asuddha Manas (impure mind) is your real enemy because it binds you to the Samsara; and the higher mind or the Sattvic mind (Suddha Manas or the pure mind) is your real friend;
because it helps you in the attainment of Moksha.
