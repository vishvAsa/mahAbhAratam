6.7 जितात्मनः of the selfcontrolled; प्रशान्तस्य of the peaceful;
परमात्मा the Supreem Self; समाहितः balanced; शीतोष्णसुखदुःखेषु in cold and heat; pleasure and pain; तथा as also; मानापमानयोः in honour and dishonour.Commentary The selfcontrolled Yogi who is rooted in the Self keeps poise amidst the pairs of opposites (Dvandvas) or the alternating waves of cold and heat; pleasure and pain; honour and dishonour. When the Yogi has subdued his senses; when his mind is balanced and peaceful under all conditions; when he is not in the least influenced by the pairts of opposites; when he has renounced all actions; then the Highest Self really becomes his own Self. He attains to Selfrealisation. As he rests in hiw own Self; he is ever serene or tranil he is not affected by the pairs of opposites; and he stands as adamant in the face of the changing conditions of Nature.
