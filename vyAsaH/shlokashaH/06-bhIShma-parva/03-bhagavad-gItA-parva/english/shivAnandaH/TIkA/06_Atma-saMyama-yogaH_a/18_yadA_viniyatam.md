6.18 यदा when; विनियतम् perfectly controlled; चित्तम् mind; आत्मनि in the Self; एव only; अवतिष्ठते rests; निःस्पृहः free from longing;
सर्वकामेभ्यः from all (objects of) desires; युक्तः united; इति thus;
उच्यते is said; तदा then.Commentary Perfectly controlled mind The mind with onepointedness.When all desires for the objects of pleasure seen or unseen die; the mind becomes very peaceful and rests steadily in the Supreme Self within. As the Yogi is perfectly harmonised; as he has attained to oneness with the Self and as he has become identical with Brahman; sense phenomena and bodily affections do not disturb him. He is conscious of his immortal; imperishable and invincible nature.Yukta means united (with the Self) or harmonised or balanced. Without union with the Self neither harmony nor balance nor Samadhi is possible.
(Cf.V.23VI.8)
