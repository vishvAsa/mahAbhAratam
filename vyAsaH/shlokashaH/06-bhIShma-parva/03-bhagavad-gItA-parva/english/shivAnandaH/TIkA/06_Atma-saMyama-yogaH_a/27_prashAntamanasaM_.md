6.27 प्रशान्तमनसम् one of peaceful mind; हि verily; एनम् this; योगिनम्
Yogi; सुखम् bliss; उत्तमम् supreme; उपैति comes; शान्तरजसम् one whose passion is ieted; ब्रह्मभूतम् one who has become Brahman; अकल्मषम् one who is free from sin.Commentary In this verse and in the next also the Lord describes the benefits of Yoga.Supreme (eternal; unalloyed and uninterrupted) bliss comes to the Yogi whose mind is perfectly serene;
who has calmed his passionate nature; who has destroyed all sorts of attachments; who has attained knowledge of the Self and thus become a Jivanmukta or one who is liberated while living; who feels that all is Brahman only; and who is taintless; i.e.; who is not affected by Dharma or Adharma (good or evil).
