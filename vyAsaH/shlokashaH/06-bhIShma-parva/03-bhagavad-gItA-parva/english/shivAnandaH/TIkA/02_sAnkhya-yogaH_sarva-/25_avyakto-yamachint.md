2.25 अव्यक्तः unmanifested; अयम् this (Self); अचिन्त्यः unthinkable;
अयम् this; अविकार्यः unchangeable; अयम् this; उच्यते is said; तस्मात्
therefore; एवम् thus; विदित्वा having known; एनम् this; न not;
अनुशोचितुम् to grieve; अर्हसि (thou) oughtest.Commentary The Self is not an object of perception. It can hardly be seen by the physical eyes.
Therefore; the Self is unmanifested. That which is seen by the eyes becomes an object of thought. As the Self cannot be perceived by the eyes; It is unthinkable. Milk when mixed with buttermilk changes its form. The Self cannot change Its form like milk. Hence; It is changeless and immutable. Therefore; thus understanding the Self; thou shouldst not mourn. Thou shouldst not think also that thou art their slayer and that they are killed by thee.
