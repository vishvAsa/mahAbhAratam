2.29 आश्चर्यवत् as a wonder; पश्यति sees; कश्चित् sone one; एनम् this
(Self); आश्चर्यवत् as a wonder; वदति speaks of; तथा so; एव also; च and;
अन्यः another; आश्चर्यवत् as a wonder; च and; एनम् this; अन्यः another;
श्रृणोति hears; श्रुत्वा having heard; अपि even; एनम् this; वेद knows; न
not; च and; एव also; कश्चित् any one.Commentary The verse may also be interpreted in this manner. He that sees; hears and speaks of the Self is a wonderful man. Such a man is very rare. He is one among many thousands. Thus the Self is very hard to understand.
