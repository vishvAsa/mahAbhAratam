2.13 देहिनः of the embodied (soul); अस्मिन् in this; यथा as; देहे in body; कौमारम् childhood; यौवनम् youth; जरा old age; तथा so also;
देहान्तरप्राप्तिः the attaining of another body; धीरः the firm; तत्र
thereat; न not; मुह्यति grieves.Commentary -- Just as there is no interruption in the passing of childhood into youth and youth into old age in this body; so also there is no interruption by death in the continuity of the ego. The Self is not dead at the termination of the stage; viz.; childhood. It is certainly not born again at the beginning of the second stage; viz.; youth. Just as the Self passes unchanged from childhood to youth and from yourth to old age; so also the Self passes unchanged from one body into,another. Therefore; the wise man is not at all distressed about it.
