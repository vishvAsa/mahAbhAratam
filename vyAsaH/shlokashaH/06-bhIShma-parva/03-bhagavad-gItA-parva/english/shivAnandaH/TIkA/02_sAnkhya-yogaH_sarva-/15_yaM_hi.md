2.15 यम् whom; हि surely; न व्यथयन्ति afflict not; एते these; पुरुषम्
man; पुरुषर्षभ chief among men; समदुःखसुखम् same in pleasure and pain;
धीरम् firm man; सः he; अमृतत्वाय for immortality; कल्पते is fit.Commentary -- Dehadhyasa or identification of the Self with the body is the cause of pleasure and pain. The more you are able to identify yourself with the immortal; allpervading Self; the less will you be affected by the pairs of opposites (Dvandvas; pleasure and pain;
etc.)Titiksha or the power of endurance develops the willpower. Calm endurance in pleasure and pain; and heat and cold is one of the alifications of an aspirant on the path of Jnana Yoga. It is one of the Shatsampat or sixfold virtues. It is a condition of right knowledge.
Titiksha by itself cannot give you Moksha or liberation; but still; when coupled with discrimination and dispassion; it becomes a means to the attainment of Immortality or knowledge of the Self. (Cf.XVII.53)
