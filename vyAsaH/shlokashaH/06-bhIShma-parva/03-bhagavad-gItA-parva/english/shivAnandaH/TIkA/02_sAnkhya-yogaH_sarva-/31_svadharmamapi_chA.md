of a Kshatriya; न not; विद्यते is.Commentary Lord Krishna now gives to Arjuna wordly reasons for fighting. Up to this time; He talked to Arjuna on the immortality of the Self and gave him philosophical reasons. Now He says to Arjuna; O Arjuna Fighting is a Kshatriyas own duty. You ought not to swerve from that duty. To a Kshatriyta (one born in the warrior or ruling class) nothing is more welcome than a righteous war. A warrior should fight.
