**English Commentary By Swami Sivananda**

2.17 अविनाशि indestructible; तु indeed; तत् That; विद्धि know (thou);
येन by which; सर्वम् all; इदम् this; ततम् is pervaded; विनाशम्
destruction; अव्ययस्य अस्य of this Imperishable; न not; कश्चित् anyone;
कर्तुम् to do; अर्हति is able.Commentary -- Brahman or Atman pervades all the objects like ether. Even if the pot is broken; the ether that is within and without the pot cannot be destroyed. Even so; if the bodies and all other objects perish; Brahman or the Self that pervades them cannot perish. It is the living Truth; Sat.Brahman has no parts. There cannot be either increase or diminution in Brahman. People are ruined by loss of wealth. But Brahman does not suffer any loss in that way. It is inexhaustible. Therefore; none can bring about the disappearance or destruction of the Self. It always exists. It is always allfull and selfcontained. It is Existence Absolute. It is immutable.
