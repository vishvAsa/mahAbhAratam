2.51 कर्मजम् actionborn; बुद्धियुक्ताः possessed of knowledsge; हि
indeed; फलम् the fruit; त्यक्त्वा having abandoned; मनीषिणः the wise;
जन्मबन्धविनिर्मुक्ताः freed from the fetters of birth; पदम् the abode;
गच्छन्ति go; अनामयम् beyond evil.Commentary Clinging to the fruits of actions is the cause of rirth. Man takes a body to enjoy them. If anyone performs actions for the sake of God in fulfilment of His purpose without desire for the fruits; he is released from the bonds of birth and attains to the blissful state or the immortal abode.Sages who possess evenness of mind abandon the fruits of their actions and thus escape from good and bad actions.Buddhi referred to in the three verses 49; 50 and 51 may be the wisdom of the Sankhyas; i.e.; the knowledge of the Self or AtmaJnana which dawns when the mind is purified by Karma Yoga.
