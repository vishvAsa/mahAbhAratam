2.69 या which; निशा night; सर्वभूतानाम् of all beings; तस्याम् in that;
जागर्ति wakes; संयमी the selfcontrolled; यस्याम् in which; जाग्रति wake;
भूतानि all beings; सा that; निशा night; पश्यतः (of the) seeing; मुनेः of the Muni.Commentary That which is real for the wordlyminded people is illusion for the sage; and vice versa. The sage lives in the Self. This is day for him. He is unconscious of the wordly phenomena. They are night for him; as it were. The ordinary man is unconscious of his real nature. Life in the spirit is night for him. He is experiencing the objects of sensual enjoyment. This is day for him. The Self is a nonentity for him For a sage this world is a nonentity.The wordlyminded people are in utter darkness as they have no knowledge of the Self. What is darkness for them is all light for the sage. The Self; Atman or Brahman is night for the worldlyminded persons. But the sage is fully awake. He is directly cognising the supreme Reality; the Light of lights. He is full of illumination and AtmaJnana or knowledge of the Self.
