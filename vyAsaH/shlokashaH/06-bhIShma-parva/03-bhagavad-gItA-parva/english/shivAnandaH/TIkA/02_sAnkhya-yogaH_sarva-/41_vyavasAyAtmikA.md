2.41 व्यवसायात्मिका onepointed; बुद्धिः determination; एका single; इह
here; कुरुनन्दन O joy of the Kurus; बहुशाखाः manybranched; हि indeed;
अनन्ताः endless; च and; बुद्धयः thoughts; अव्यवसायिनाम् of the irresoulte.Commentary Here; in this path to Bliss there is only one thought of a resolute nature there is singleminded determination. This single thought arises from the right source of knowledge. The student of Yoga collects all the dissipated rays of the mind. He gathers all of them through discrimination; dispassion and concentration. He is free from wavering or vacillation of the mind.The worldlyminded man who is suck in the mire of Samsara has no singleminded determination. He entertains countless thoughts. His mind is always unsteady and vacillating.If thoughts cease; Samsara also ceases. Mind generates endless thoughts and this world comes into being. Thoughts; and names and forms are inseparable. If the thoughts are controlled; the mind is controlled and the Yogi is liberated.
