2.64 रागद्वेषवियुक्तैः free from attraction and repulsion; तु but;
विषयान् objects; इन्द्रियैः with senses; चरन् moving (amongst);
आत्मवश्यैः selfrestrained; विधेयात्मा the selfcontrolled; प्रसादम् to peace; अधिगच्छति attains.Commentary The mind and the senses are naturally endowed with the two currents of attraction and repulsion.
Therefore; the mind and the senses like certain objects and dislike certain other objects. But the disciplined man moves among senseobjects with the mind and the senses free from attraction and repulsion and mastered by the Self; attains to the peace of the Eternal. The senses and the mind obey his will; as the disciplined self has a very strong will. The disciplined self takes only those objects which are ite necessary for the maintenance of the body without any love or hatred. He never takes those objects which are forbidden by the scriptures.In this verse Lord Krishna gives the answer to Arjunas fourth estion; How does a sage of steady wisdom move about (Cf.III.7.19;25XVIII.9).
