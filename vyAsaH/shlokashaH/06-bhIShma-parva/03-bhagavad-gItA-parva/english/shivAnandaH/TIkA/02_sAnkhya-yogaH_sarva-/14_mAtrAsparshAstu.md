2.14 मात्रास्पर्शाः contacts of senses with objects; तु indeed; कौन्तेय
O Kaunteya (son of Kunti); शीतोष्णसुखदुःखदाः producers of cold and heat;
pleasure and pain; आगमापायिनः with beginning and end; अनित्याः
impermanent; तान् them; तितिक्षस्व bear (thou); भारत O Bharata.Commentary -- Cold is pleasant at one time and painful at another. Heat is pleasant in winter but painful in summer. The same object that gives pleasure at one time gives pain at another time. So the sensecontacts that give rise to the sensations of heat and cold;
pleasure and pain come and go. Therefore; they are impermanent in nature. The objects come in contact with the senses or the Indriyas;
viz.; skin; ear; eye; nose; etc.; and the sensations are carried by the nerves to the mind which has its seat in the brain. It is the mind that feels pleasure and pain. One should try to bear patiently heat and cold;
pleasure and pain and develop a balanced state of mind. (Cf.V.22)
