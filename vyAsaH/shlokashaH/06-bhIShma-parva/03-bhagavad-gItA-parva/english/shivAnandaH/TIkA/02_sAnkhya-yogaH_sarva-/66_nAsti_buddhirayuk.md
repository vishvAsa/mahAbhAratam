2.66 न not; अस्ति is; बुद्धिः knowledge (of the Self); अयुक्तस्य of the unsteady; न not; च and; अयुक्तस्य of the unsteady; भावना meditation; न
not; च and; अभावयतः of the unmeditated; शान्तिः peace; अशान्तस्य of the peaceless; कुतः whence; सुखम् happiness.Commentary The man who cannot fix his mind in meditation cannot have knowledge of the Self. The unsteady man cannot practise meditation. He cannot have even intense devotion to Selfknowledge nor can he have burning longing for liberation or Moksha. He who does not practise meditation cannot possess peace of mind. How can the man who has no peace of mind enjoy happinessDesire or Trishna (thirsting for senseobjects) is the enemy of peace. There cannot be an iota or tinge of happiness for a man who is thirsting for sensual objects. The mind will be ever restless; and will be hankering for the objects. Only when this thirsting dies; does man enjoy peace. Only then can he meditate and rest in the Self.
