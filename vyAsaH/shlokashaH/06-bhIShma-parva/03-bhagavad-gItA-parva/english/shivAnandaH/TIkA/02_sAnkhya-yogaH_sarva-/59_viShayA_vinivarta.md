2.59 विषयाः the objects of senses; विनिवर्तन्ते turn away; निराहारस्य
abstinent; देहिनः of the man; रसवर्जम् leaving the longing; रसः loving
(taste); अपि even; अस्य of his; परम् the Supreme; दृष्ट्वा having seen;
निवर्तते turns away.Commentary Knowledge of the Self alone can destroy in toto the subtle Vasanas (latent tendencies) and all the subtle desires; all subtle attachments and even the longing for objects. By practising severe austerities; by abandoning the sensual objects; the objects of the senses may turn away from the ascetic but the relish or taste or longing for the objects will still remain.
