whose; इन्द्रियाणि senses; तस्य his; प्रज्ञा wisdom; प्रतिष्ठिता is settled.Commentary He should control the senses and sit focussed on Me as the Supreme; with a calm mind. The wisdom of the Yogi who thus seated has brought all his senses under subjugation is doubtless ite steady. He is established in the Self. Sri Sankaracharya explains Asita Matparah as He should sit contemplating I am no other than He. (Cf.II.64).
