(he) is called.Commentary In this verse Lord Krishna gives His answer to the first part of Arjunas estion.If anyone gets sugarcandy will he crave for blacksugar Certainly not. If anyone can attain the supreme bliss of the Self; will he thirst for the sensual pleasures No; not at all. The sumtotal of all the pleasures of the world will seem worthless for the sage of steady wisdom who is satisfied in the Self. (Cf.III.17VI.7;8).
