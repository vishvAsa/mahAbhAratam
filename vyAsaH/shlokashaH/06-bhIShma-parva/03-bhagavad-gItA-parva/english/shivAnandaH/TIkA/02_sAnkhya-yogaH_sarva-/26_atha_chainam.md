2.26 अथ now; च and; एनम् this (Self); नित्यजातम् constantly born;
नित्यम् constantly; वा or; मन्यसे thinkest; मृतम् dead; तथापि even then;
त्वम् thou; महाबाहो mightyarmed; न not; एवम् thus; शोचितुम् to grieve;
अर्हसि (thou) oughtest.Commentary Lord Krishna here; for the sake of argument; takes up the popular supposition. Granting that the Self is again and again born whenever a body comes into being; and again and again dies whenever the body dies; O mightyarmed (O Arjuna of great valour and strength); thou shouldst not grieve thus; because birth is inevitable to want is dead and death is inevitable to what is born. This is the inexorable or unrelenting Law of Nature.
