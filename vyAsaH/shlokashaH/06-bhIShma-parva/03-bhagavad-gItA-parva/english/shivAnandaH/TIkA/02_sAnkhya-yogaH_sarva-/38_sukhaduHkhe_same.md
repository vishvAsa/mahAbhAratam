2.38 सुखदुःखे pleasure and pain; समे same; कृत्वा having made; लाभालाभौ
gain and loss; जयाजयौ victory and defeat; ततः then; युद्धाय for battle;
युज्यस्व engage thou; न not; एवम् thus; पापम् sin; अवाप्स्यसि shalt incur.Commentary This is the Yoga of eanimity or the doctrine of poise in action. If anyone does any action with the above mental attitude or balanced state of mind he will not reap the fruits of his action. Such an action will lead to the purification of his heart and freedom from birth and death. One has to develop such a balanced state of mind through continous struggle and vigilant efforts.
