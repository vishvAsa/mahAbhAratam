2.35 भयात् from fear; रणात् from the battle; उपरतम् withdrawn; मंस्यन्ते
will think; त्वाम् thee; महारथाः the great carwarriors; येषाम् of whom;
च and; त्वम् thou; बहुमतः much thought of; भूत्वा having been; यास्यसि
will receive; लाघवम् lightness.Commentary Duryodhana and others will certainly think that you have fled from the battle from fear of Karna and others; but not through compassion and reverence for elders and teachers. Duryodhana and others who have shown great esteem to you on account of your chivalry; bravery and other noble alities; will think very lightly of you and treat you with contempt.
