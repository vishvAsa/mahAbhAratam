2.45 त्रैगुण्यविषयाः deal with the three attributes; वेदाः the Vedas;
निस्त्रैगुण्यः without these three attributes; भव be; अर्जुन O Arjuna
निर्द्वन्द्वः free from the pairs of opposites; नित्यसत्त्वस्थः ever remaining in the Sattva (goodness); निर्योगक्षेमः free from (the thought of) acisition and preservation; आत्मवान् established in the Self.Commentary Guna means attribute or ality. It is substance as well as ality. Nature (Prakriti) is made up of three Gunas; viz.; Sattva
(purity; light or harmony); Rajas (passion or motion) and Tamas
(darkness or inertia). The pairs of opposites are heat and cold;
pleasure and pain; gain and loss; victory and defeat; honour and dishonour; praise and censure. He who is anxious about new acuqisitions or about the preservation of his old possessions cannot have peace of mind. He is ever restless. He cannot concentrate or meditate on the Self. He cannot practise virtue. Therefore; Lord Krishna advises Arjuna that he should be free from the thought of acisition and preservation of things. (Cf.IX.20;21).
