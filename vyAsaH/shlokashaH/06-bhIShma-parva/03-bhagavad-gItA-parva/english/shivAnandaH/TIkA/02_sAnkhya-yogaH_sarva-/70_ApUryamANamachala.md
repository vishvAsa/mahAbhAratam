2.70 आपूर्यमाणम् filled from all sides; अचलप्रतिष्ठम् based in stillness; समुद्रम् ocean; आपः water; प्रविशन्ति enter; यद्वत् as;
तद्वत् so; कामाः desires; यम् whom; प्रविशन्ति enter; सर्वे all; सः he;
शान्तिम् peace; आप्नोति attains; न not; कामकामी desirer of desires.Commentary Just as the ocean filled with waters from all sides remains unmoved; so also the sage who is resting in his own Svarupa or the Self is not a bit affected though desires of all sorts enter from all sides. The sage attains peace or liberation but not he who longs for objects of sensual enjoyment and entertains various desires.
(Cf.XVIII.53;54).
