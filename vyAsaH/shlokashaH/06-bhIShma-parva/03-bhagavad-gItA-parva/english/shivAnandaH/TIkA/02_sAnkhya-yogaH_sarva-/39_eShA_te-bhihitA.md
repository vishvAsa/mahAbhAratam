2.39 एषा this; ते to thee; अभिहिता (is) declared; साङ्ख्ये in Sankhya;
बुद्धिः wisdom; योगे in the Yoga; तु indeed; इमाम् this; श्रृणु hear;
बुद्ध्या with wisdom; युक्तः endowed with; यया which; पार्थ O Partha;
कर्मबन्धम् bondage of Karma; प्रहास्यसि (thou) shalt cast off.Commentary Lord Krishna taught Jnana (knowledge) to Arjuna till now. (Sankhya Yoga is the path of Vedanta or Jnana Yoga; which treats of the nature of the Atman or the Self and the methods to attain Selfrealisation. It is not the Sankhya philosophy of sage Kapila.) He is now giving to teach Arjuna the technie or secret of Karma Yoga endowed with which he (or anybody else) can break through the bonds of Karma. The Karma Yogi should perform work without expectation of fruits of his actions; without the idea of agency (or the notin I do this); without attachment; after annihilating or going beyond all the pairs of opposites such as heat and cold; gain and loss; victoyr and defeat; etc. Dharma and Adharma; or merit and demerit will not touch that Karma Yogi who works without attachment and egoism. The Karma Yogi consecrates all his works and their fruits as offerings unto the Lord (Isvararpanam) and thus obtains the grace of the Lord (Isvaraprasada).
