the mind.Commentary The aspirant should first bring the senses under his control. The senses are like horses. If you keep the horses under your perfect control you can reach your destinaton safely. Turbulent horses will throw you down on the way. Even so the turbulent senses will hurl you down into the objects of the senses and you cannot reach your spiritual destination; viz.; Param Dhama (the supreme abode) or the abode of eternal peace and immortality or Moksha (final liberation).
(Cf.III.33V.14).
