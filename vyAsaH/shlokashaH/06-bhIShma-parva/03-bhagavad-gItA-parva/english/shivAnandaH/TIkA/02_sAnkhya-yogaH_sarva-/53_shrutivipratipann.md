(thou) shalt attain.Commentary When your intellect which is tossed about by the conflict of opinions regarding the Pravritti Marga (the path of action) and the Nivritti Marga (the path of retirement or renunciation)
has become immovable without distraction and doubt and firmly established in the Self; then thou shalt attain Selfrealisation or knowledge of the Self (AtmaJnana).
