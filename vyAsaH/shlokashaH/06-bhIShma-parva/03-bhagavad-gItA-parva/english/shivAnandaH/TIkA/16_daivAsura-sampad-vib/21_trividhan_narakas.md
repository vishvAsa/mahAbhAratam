16.21 त्रिविधम् triple; नरकस्य of hell; इदम् this; द्वारम् gate; नाशनम्
destructive; आत्मनः of the self; कामः lust; क्रोधः anger; तथा also; लोभः
greed; तस्मात् therefore; एतत् this; त्रयम् three; त्यजेत् (one) should abandon.Commentary Lust; anger and greed; -- these highway robbers will cause a man to fall into the dark abyss of hell; misery or grief. These are the three fountainheads of misery. These three constitute the gateway leading to the lowest of hells. These are the enemies of peace;
devotion and knowledge. When these evil modifications of the mind arise in it; man loses his balance or poise and discrimination and commits various evil actions.Lust; anger and greed denote selfblindness and ignorance; for there are no Vasanas; wants; anger; or greed in Brahman or the pure immortal Self.Narakasya dvaram The gate to hell The gate leading to hell. The self is destroyed by merely entering at the gate;
i.e.; it is not fit to do any right exertion to attain the goal of life.As this gate causes selfdestruction; let everyone renounce these three. (Cf.III.47)In the next verse the man who has abandoned these three evils is highyl eulogised.
