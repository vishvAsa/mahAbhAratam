16.15 आढ्यः rich; अभिजनवान् wellborn; अस्मि (I) am; कः who; अन्यः else;
अस्ति is; सदृशः eal; मया to me; यक्ष्ये (I) will sacrifice; दास्यामि (I)
will give; मोदिष्ये (I) will rejoice; इति thus; अज्ञानविमोहिताः deluded by ignorance.Commentary Kubera (the god of wealth) may be wealthy; but he cannot be compared with me. Even Vishnu Himself does not possess the wealth that I possess. In comparison with my illustrious family and the extent of my relations even Brahma is indeed of inferior descent. They are as nothing when compared with me. Who then is there in the whole world eal to meWellborn Born in a family learned in the scriptures for seven generations. None is eal to me in this respect. I will do may sacrificial rites to get name and fame. None is eal to me in this respect also. I will give money and presents to those who entertain me with dance; music and songs in praise of me. None is eal to me in charity (giving) also. I will indulge in eating; drinking and women.
