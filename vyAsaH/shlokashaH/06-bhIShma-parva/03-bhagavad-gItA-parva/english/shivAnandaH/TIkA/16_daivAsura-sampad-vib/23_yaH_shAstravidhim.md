title = "23 यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य"

16.23 यः who; शास्त्रविधिम् the ordinance of the scriptures; उत्सृज्य
having cast aside; वर्तते acts; कामकारतः under the impulse of desire; न
not; सः he; सिद्धिम् perfection; अवाप्नोति attains; न not; सुखम्
happiness; न not; पराम् Supreme; गतिम् Goal.Commentary He who does not care for the Self; who gives free rein to these three sins; is a traitor to the Self. He who has renounced the authority of the Vedas which; like a mother; is eally disposed and kind to all; and which; like a beaconlight; points out what is good and what is evil; does not attain perfection nor happiness nor the Supreme Goal. He who pays no attention to prescribed actions and follows the promptings of desire awakened by the senses; does not obtain God.
