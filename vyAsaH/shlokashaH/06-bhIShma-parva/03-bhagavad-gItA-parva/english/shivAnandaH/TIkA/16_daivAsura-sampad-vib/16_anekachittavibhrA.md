16.16 अनेकचित्तविभ्रान्ताः bewildred by many a fancy; मोहजालसमावृताः
entangled in the snare of delusion; प्रसक्ताः addicted; कामभोगेषु to the gratification of lust; पतन्ति (they) fall; नरके into hell; अशुचौ
foul.Commentary Just as a man utters many incoherent words when he gets delirium or high fever; so also these diabolical men prattle about their desires; sensual enjoyment; etc. They commit,countless sins and so they fall into a foul hell such as the Vaitarani. Delusion is a snare because those who are deluded are entrapped. They are caught like fish in the meshes of the net of delusion. They are enveloped by the net on four sides. They are bewildered as to what to do first and what next. As they are enveloped or covered by delusion; they are bewildered in various ways by entertaining various evil thoughts. They have no discrimination between the proper or beneficial and improper or harmful Sadhanas. The lack of the knowledge of the distinction between these two is Moha. As Mohas is a veil and a cause of bondage it is compared to a net.All the alities mentioned above lead to downfall.
