16.13 इदम् this; अद्य today; मया by me; लब्धम् has been gained; इमम्
this; प्राप्स्ये (I) shall obtain; मनोरथम् desire; इदम् this; अस्ति is;
इदम् this; अपि also; मे to me; भविष्यति shall be; पुनः again; धनम्
wealth.Commentary I will be able to acire all that the world possesses.
Then I will be the lord of all wealth. No one will be eal to me on the surface of this earth.In future Next year this wealth also shall be mine. I will be known to the world as a man of immense wealth. People will address me as my lord.These demons (who think like this) become selfconceited on account of their wealth. Their heads are swollen with pride. They regard everyone else as worthless as straw. Pride of wealth destroyes their power of discrimination. They strive for happiness but they never obtain it. They are entangled in the meshes of Maya. They are wedded to sin and misry here and hereafter.
