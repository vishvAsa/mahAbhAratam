Creation here means what is created. The men who are created with the two kinds of nature; the divine and the demonical; are here mentioned as the two creations. Every man in this world comes under the one or the other of the two creations; the divine and the demoniacal.Lord Krishna says to Arjuna; I will now describe to thee the characteristics of those men who are endowed with the devilish alities. If you have an understanding of the demoniacal alities; you will avoid them. The demoniacal nature is described in detail to the very end of this discourse.There is some reference in chapter IX; verses 9; 11 and 12; to the demoniacal nature but as the description is incomplete it is completed in this discourse.The divine nature has been declared in detail by the blessed Lord in the previous chapters -- the state of a Sthitaprajna in chapter II; the state of a Bhagavata in chapter XII and the state of a Trigunatita in chapter XIV and in the first three verses of this discourse.
