They have attained to My Being. They have become identical with Me. They live in Me with no thought of thou or I. They go beyond birth and death. There is no birth for them when creation begins and there is no death for them at the time of dissolution. Having reached Me they attain eternity; immortality and perfection. Having become identical with Me through the attainment of the knowledge of the Self by practising the necessary means; they are neither born at the time of creation nor are they disited at the time of dissolution.
Knowledge of the Self is eulogised by the Lord in this verse.
