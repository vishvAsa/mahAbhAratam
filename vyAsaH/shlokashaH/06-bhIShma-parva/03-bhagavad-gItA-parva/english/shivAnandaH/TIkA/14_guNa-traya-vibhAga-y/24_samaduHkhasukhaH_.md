14.24 समदुःखसुखः alike in pleasure and pain; स्वस्थः standing in his own Self; समलोष्टाश्मकाञ्चनः regarding a clod of earth; a stone and gold alike; तुल्यप्रियाप्रियः the same to the dear and the undear; धीरः firm;
तुल्यनिन्दात्मसंस्तुतिः the same in censure and praise. Commentary Night and day have no meaning to a post fixed in the ground. Even so pleasure and pain have no meaning to a sage who dwells in his own Self. He is above the pairs of opposites. In his eyes cowdung or gold; a jewel or a stone; are of eal value. He is free from the idea of,giving and taking.
His mind is not perturbed by anything pleasant or unpleasant. He is the same towards agreeable and disagreeable things. Praise and censure cannot affect him. He stands adamant. He abides in his own essential state as ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute. He is ever calm and serene.
(Cf.V.18)
