14.19 न not; अन्यम् other; गुणेभ्यः than the Gunas; कर्तारम् agent; यदा
when; द्रष्टा the seer; अनुपश्यति beholds; गुणेभ्यः than the alities; च
and; परम् higher; वेत्ति knows; मद्भावम् My Being; सः he;
अधिगच्छति,attains to.Commentary The Supreme Self is in no way contaminated by the alities. The liberated sage exclaims I am the witness of the alities. I am neither the enjoyer nor the doer. The alities form the motive power of all actions. I am beyond the Gunas. The Gunas alone are responsible for all actions. I am entirely distinct from the alities. I am pure consciousness. I cannot be touched by the alities. I am like the ether.When a man gets illumination or attains knowledge of the Self; when he realises that there is no agent except the Gunas which are themselves modified as the bodies; the senses and their objects; when he knows that it is the Gunas only that become the agent in all transformations; in all states and in all actions; and when he realises the Supreme Self Who is distinct from the Gunas; Who is the silent witness of the Gunas and their functions; he attains to My state
(liberation); i.e.; becomes identical with Me. He becomes a Gunatita;
i.e.; one who has transcended the three Gunas.
