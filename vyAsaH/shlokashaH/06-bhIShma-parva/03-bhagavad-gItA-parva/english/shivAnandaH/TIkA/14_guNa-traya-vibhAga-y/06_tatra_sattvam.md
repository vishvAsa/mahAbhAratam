14.6 तत्र of these; सत्त्वम् purity; निर्मलत्वात् from its stainlessness; प्रकाशकम् luminous; अनामयम् healthy; सुखसङ्गेन by attachment to happiness; बध्नाति binds; ज्ञानसङ्गेन by attachment to knowledge; च and; अनग O sinless one.Commentary Sattva is stainless like the crystal. It lays for one the trap of happiness and knowledge. It is a golden fetter. A Sattvic man compares himself with others and rejoices in his excellence. He is puffed up with his knowledge. His heart is filled with pride when he thinks that he,has more comforts or more pleasant experiences. He thinks; I am happy I am wise; and so he is bound as it were. These ideas really belong to the field but they are transferred through superimposition to the Self on account of the force of SattvaGuna.Rajas and Tamas are pitfalls on the path of knowledge.This attachment to happiness is an illusion. This is ignorance. An attribute of the object cannot belong to the subject. All the alities from desire to firmness (Cf.XIII.6) belong to the field. From ignorance;
nondiscrimination is born and so the individual self is not able to discriminate between the permanent and the impermanent; the subject and the object.Knowledge is an attribute of the Antahkarana (inner instrument; viz.; mind; intellect; the unconscious and the ego) but not of the Self. It if were an attribute of the Self; it could not produce attachment and bondage. Sattva binds the soul to knowledge through attachment.
