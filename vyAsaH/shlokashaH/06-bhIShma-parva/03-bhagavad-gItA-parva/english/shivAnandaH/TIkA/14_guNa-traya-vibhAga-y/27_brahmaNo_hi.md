14.27 ब्रह्मणः of Brahman; हि indeed; प्रतिष्ठा the abode; अहम् I;
अमृतस्य the immortal; अव्ययस्य the immutable; च and; शाश्वतस्य
everlasting; च and; धर्मस्य of Dharma; सुखस्य of bliss; एकान्तिकस्य
absolute; च and.Commentary The Self Which is immortal and immutable;
Which is attainable by the eternal Dharma or the knowledge of the Self;
Which is unending bliss; abides in Me; the Supreme Being.,I; the innermost Self; am the abode of the Supreme Self. The aspirant beholds;
with the eye of intuition; that the innermost Self is the very Supreme Self; through Selfrealisation.The Lord bestows grace and mercy on His devotees through His Sakti; energy or power; or Maya. Sakti and the Lord are one. Just as heat is inseparable from fire; so also Maya or Sakti is inseparable from the Lord. Sakti cannot be distinct from the Lord in Whom She inheres.There is another interpretation. By Brahman here is meant the Brahman with attributes or alities; the conditioned Brahman.
I; the Absolute Brahman; transcending the attributes or alities; the unconditioned Absolute; am the abode of the Saguna (conditioned) Brahman Who is immortal and imperishable. I am also the abode of the eternal Dharma of Jnananishtha (establishment in the highest wisdom) and the abode of the unending bliss born of that unswerving devotion.Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita; the science of the Eternal;
the scripture of Yoga; the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna; ends the fourteenth discourse entitledThe Yoga of the Division of the Three Gunas.,
