14.26 माम् Me; च and; यः who; अव्यभिचारेण unswerving; भक्तियोगेन with devotion; सेवते serves; सः he; गुणान् Gunas; समतीत्य crossing beyond;
एतान् these; ब्रह्मभूयाय for becoming Brahman; कल्पते is fit.Commentary A Sannyasi or even a Karma Yogi who serves Him (the Isvara; Narayana Who abides in the hearts of all beings) with unswerving devotion; is endowed with the knowledge of the Self. He then goes beyond the three alities and becomes fit to become Brahman; for attaining liberation or release from birth and death.He attains to the knowledge of the Self through the grace and mercy of the Lord. To these everharmonious devotees worshipping Me in love; I give the Yoga of discrimination by which they come unto Me. Out of pure compassion for them; dwelling within their Self; I destroy the ignorancorn darkness by the shining lamp of wisdom.
(Chapter X. 10 and 11)Avyabhicharini Bhakti The devotee constantly meditates on the Lord. He has exclusive devotion to the Lord alone. He has no other thought save that of his Lord. His mind is filled with the thoughts of the Lord. His thoughts flow towards the Lord like the continuous flow of oil from one vessel to another. There is Sajatiya Vritti Pravaha; i.e.; unbroken flow of the one thought of God. There is total abandonment of thoughts of sensual objects. Constant thinking of God is the sure means for crossing beyond the three alities of Nature.
