They have no other thoughts except those,of Myself. They live for Me only. Therefore it is indeed proper to say that they are the best Yogins.Are not the others; those who contemplate the imperishable; formless; attributeless; alityless Supreme Brahman; the best of Yogins Listen now to what I have to say regarding them.
