selfcontrolled.Commentary This is the easiest path. If thou art unable to perform actions for My sake; if thou canst not even be intent on My service; if thou art unable to practise the Bhagavata Dharmas; if thous wishest to do actions impelled by personal desires; then do thou perform them (for your sake from a sense of duty) renouncing them all in Me and also abandon the fruits of all actions; at the same time practising selfcontrol.In verse 8 the Yoga of meditation is prescribed for advanced students in verse 9 the Yoga of constant practice if one finds that;
too; to be difficult; the performance of actions for the sake of the Lord alone has been taught in verse 10 and those who cannot do even this are asked to abandon the fruits of all actions.Madyogam My Yoga.
Surrendering all actions and their fruits to Me is My Yoga.Yatatmavan The man of discrimination who has controlled all the senses; who has withdrawn the senses from sound; touch; form; taste and smell.Now the Lord eulogises the renunciation of the fruits of all actions in order to encourage the aspirants to practise the Yoga of renunciation of the fruits of actions.
