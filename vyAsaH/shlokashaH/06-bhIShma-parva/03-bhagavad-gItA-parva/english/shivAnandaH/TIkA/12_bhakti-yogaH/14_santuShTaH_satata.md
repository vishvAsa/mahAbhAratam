12.14 सन्तुष्टः contented; सततम् ever; योगी Yogi; यतात्मा
selfcontrolled; दृढनिश्चयः possessed of firm,conviction; मयि
अर्पितमनोबुद्धिः with mind and intellect dedicated to Me; यः who;
मद्भक्तः My devotee; सः he; मे to Me; प्रियः dear.Commentary He knows that all that comes to him is the fruit of his own actions in the past and so he is ever contented. He does not endeavour to attain the finite or perishable objects. He fixes his mind and intellect on the Supreme Being or the Absolute; attains eternal satisfaction and stands adamant like yonder rock; amidst the vicissitudes of time.Contentment ever dwells in the heart of My devotee. Like the ocean which is ever full;
his heart is ever full as he has no cravings. He is ever cheerful and joyous. He has a feeling of fullness whether or not he gets the means for the bare sustencance of his body. He is satisfied with a little thing and he does not care whether it is good or not. He never grumbles;
complains or murmurs when he does not obtain food and clothing which are necessary for the maintenance of the body. His mind is ever filled with Me through constant and steady meditation.Yogi He who has evenness of mind always. He has controlled all the senses and desires. With a firm determination he has fixed his mind and intellect on Me in a spirit of perfect selfsurrender. He is endowed with a firm conviction regarding the essential nature of the Self. He who has the knowledge through Selfrealisation; I am Asanga Akarta Suddha Satchidananda Svayamprakasa Advitiya Brahman (unattached; nondoer; pure; ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute; selfluminous; nondual Brahman) is a sage of firm determination. He has given to Me exclusively his mind (the faculty that wills and doubts) and the intellect (the faculty that determines). He is dear to Me as life itself. Such a comparison falls far short of the reality.The same thing which was said by Lord Krishna to Arjuna in chapter VII. 17; I am very dear to the wise and he is very dear to Me;
is here described in detail.
