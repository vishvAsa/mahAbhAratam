12.19 तुल्यनिन्दास्तुतिः to whom censure and praise are eal; मौनी --
silent; सन्तुष्टः contented; येनकेनचित् with anything; अनिकेतः homeless;
स्थिरमतिः steadyminded; भक्तिमान् full of devotion; मे to Me; प्रियः
dear; नरः (that) man.Commentary He is neither elated by praise nor pained by censure. He keeps a balanced state of mind. He has controlled the organ of speech and so he is silent. His mind also is serene and silent as he has controlled the thoughts also. He is ite content with the bare means of bodily sustenance. It is said in the Mahabharata
(Santi Parva; Moksha Dharma) Who is dressed in anything; who eats any kind of food; who lies down anywhere; him the gods call a Brahmana or a liberated sage or Jivanmukta.He does not dwell in one place. He has no fixed abode. He is homeless. He regards the world as his dwelling place.
His mind is ever fixed on Brahman. (Cf.VII.17IX.29XII.17)
