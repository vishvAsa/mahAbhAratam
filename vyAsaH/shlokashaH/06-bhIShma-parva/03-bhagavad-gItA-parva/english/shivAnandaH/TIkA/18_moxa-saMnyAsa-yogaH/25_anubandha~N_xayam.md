He does not discriminate between the good and the bad; or what is ones own and what belongs to another.Kshayam Loss of power and of wealth; resulting from the performance of an action.Himsa Injury to living beings.Paurusham Ones own ability or capacity to complete the work.Now listen to the characteristics that pertain to the pure agent.
