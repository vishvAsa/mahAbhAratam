The senses are withdrawn into the mind. The Prana and the Apana pass into the Sushumna Nadi.Yoga Samadhi or concentration of the mind. You cannot restrain the mind; the lifeforce and the senses by mere firmness. You can control them only by firmness which is ever accompanied by concentration of the mind.When the mind; the lifeforce and the senses are curbed by unwarvering firmness;
they cannot run towards external sensual objects; they cannot do any mischief; they cannot move in ways which are opposed to the scriptures;
they will be absorbed into their respective causes and their outgoing tendencies will be totally checked.This firmness is not repression or suppression; but an intelligent sublimation and inner transformation.
