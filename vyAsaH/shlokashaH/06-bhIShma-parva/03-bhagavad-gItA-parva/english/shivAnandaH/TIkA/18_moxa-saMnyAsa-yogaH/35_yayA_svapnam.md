Tamasic (dark).Commentary The man who is an embodiment of darkness is made up of every possible kind of evil. He is very indolent and sinful.
He is inordinately addicted to sleep. He considers these to be only proper. He experiences sorrow on account of his evil actions. As he is very much attached to the body he entertains great fear. He is ever discontented at heart. He is lustful and selfconceited. He does not know how to behave. He is rude and insolent. He indulges much in sensual pleasures.
