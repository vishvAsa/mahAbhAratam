18.7 नियतस्य obligatory; तु verily; संन्यासः renunciation; कर्मणः of action; न not; उपपद्यते is proper; मोहात् from delusion; तस्य of the same; परित्यागः abandonment; तामसः Tamasic; परिकीर्तितः is declared.Commentary Renunciation of obligatory action is not proper because it is purifying in the case of an ignorant man. Should a man renounce actions that he should perform as a duty; such renunciation can only be of the ality of darkness. Prescribed duties must not be abandoned and if anyone does so; he is certainly deluded by ignorance.
Tamas is ignorance.Niyata Prescribed according to ones religion. To hold that a duty is obligatory and then to relinish it is indeed selfcontradictory.
