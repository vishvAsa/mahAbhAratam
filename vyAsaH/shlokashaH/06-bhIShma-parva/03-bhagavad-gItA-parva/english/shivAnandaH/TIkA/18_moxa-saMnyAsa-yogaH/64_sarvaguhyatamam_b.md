18.64 सर्वगुह्यतमम् the most secret of all; भूयः again; श्रृणु hear; मे
My; परमम् supreme; वचः word; इष्टः beloved; असि (thou) art; मे of Me;
दृढम् dearly; इति thus; ततः therefore; वक्ष्यामि (I) will speak; ते thy;
हितम् what is good.Commentary Now listen once more with rapt attention to My words. Thou art very dear to Me. Thou art a sincere aspirant.
Therefore I am telling thee this most mysterious truth. Hear from Me this mystery of all mysteries. I shall tell it to you again to make a deep impression on your mind; although it has been declared more than once. I do not hope to get any reward from thee. Thou art My most beloved friend and disciple. Therefore I will speak what is good for thee; the means of attaining Selfrealisation. This is the supreme good or the highest of all kinds of good for thee.
