best.Commentary This is a summary of the doctrine of Karma Yoga enunciated before on several occasions. The fault of defect of Karma is certainly not in the action itself; but in the expectation of reward and attachment.Etani api Even these Sacrifice; charity and austerity also;
in the same way as other unselfish actions. Even these refers to acts of sacrifice; charity and austerity. Actions that are performed in an unselfish spirit without attachment and idea of agency; do not stand in the way of your obtaining emancipation. When actions are done without expectation of rewards; Rajas and Tamas are destroyed and the mind is filled with Sattva or purity. Actions done with the spirit of selflessness and with discrimination are instrumental in destroying the bonds of Karma (the law of cause and effect).The Lord said Hear from Me the conclusion or the final truth about renunciation (verse 4 above).
Then He said with all the force of His authority that acts of sacrifice;
charity and austerity should not be given up as they are purifiers of the wise. Even these actions should be performed; etc.; is only the conclusion of what the Lord has stated in verse 4.The word Api (even)
implies that the acts of sacrifice; charity and austerity should be done by an aspirant although they bind one who has attachment to the actions and a desire for their reward.Just as the seeds of trees can be rendered barren by being scorched; so the aspirant burns the fruitbearing tendency of Karma through the abandonment of the desire for the reward.
