18.32 अधर्मम् Adharma; धर्मम् Dharma; इति thus; या which; मन्यते thinks;
तमसा by darkness; आवृता enveloped; सर्वार्थान् all things; विपरीतान्
perverted; च and; बुद्धिः intellect; सा that; पार्थ O Partha; तामसी
Tamasic (dark).Commentary That intellect which regards righteous acts as evil; and considers right things to be false; which treats everything in a contrary sense and looks upon virtues as if they were vices and takes everything that the scriptures declare to be good as being entirely wrong; is Tamasic. It views all things in a perverted light.Thus; O Arjuna; I have explained to thee the three aspects of the intellect. Now listen to the explanation of the characteristics of the three aspects of firmness.
