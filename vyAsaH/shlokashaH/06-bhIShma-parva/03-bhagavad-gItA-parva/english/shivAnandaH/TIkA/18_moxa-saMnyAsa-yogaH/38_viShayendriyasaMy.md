He who indulges in sensual pleasures will have to experience pain also; side by side. He is afraid of losing the objects that give him pleasure. He is attached to them. Attachment is death. It brings him again and again to this world of death. Fear and attachment coexist with sensual pleasure. He has to exert a lot to get money. He can obtain the objects through money. During exertion he commits many sinful acts and he will have to suffer in hell. The next birth will be of a very low nature. He tells lies and cheats people to obtain money.
The senses also lose their vigour through indulgence in sensual pleasure. He loses his strength; vigour; wealth and energy. His intellect becomes dull; weak; impure; turbid and perverted. He loses his money and proper understanding. (Cf.V.22)
