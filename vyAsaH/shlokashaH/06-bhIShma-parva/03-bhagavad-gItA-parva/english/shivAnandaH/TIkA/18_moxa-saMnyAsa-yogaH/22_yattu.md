अतत्त्वार्थवत् without foundation in Truth; अल्पम् trivial; च and; तत्
that;,तामसम् Tamasic (dark); उदाहृतम् is declared.Commentary The knowledge which regards that each and every object or being exists by itself and is perfect by itself; is Tamasic.One single effect Such as the body; thinking it to be the Self; or an idol; taking it for God; and thinking that there is nothing higher than that.The naked Jains consider that the soul which dwells in the body is of the same size as that of the body. Some regard that Isvara is a mere piece of stone or wood. Such knowledge is really not based on reason. It does not see things in their true light. It is narrow (Alpam) as it is not founded on reason. It produces very small results too. It extends over a limited area and is not allcomprehensive. This knowledge is said to be Tamasic; as it is found in Tamasic persons who are devoid of the power of discrimination.
