18.13 पञ्च five; एतानि these; महाबाहो O mightyarmed; कारणानि causes;
निबोध learn; मे from Me; साङ्ख्ये in the Sankhya; कृतान्ते which is the end of all actions; प्रोक्तानि as declared; सिद्धये for the accomplishment; सर्वकर्मणाम् of all actions.Commentary The Self has no connection whatevr with activity. Nature does everything. The Self is the silent witness. He remains indifferent. The whole superstructure of human activity is the result of the five welldefined causes which are enumerated in the following verse.Etani These Which are going to be mentioned.Sankhya Vedanta Knowledge of the Self as taught in the Vedanta
(the Upanishads) puts an end to all actions. This is the reason why the term Kritante (the end of actions) is used here. When the knowledge of the Self arises; all actions terminate. This is taught in chapter II;
verse 46 To the Brahman who has known the Self al the Vedas are of so much use as is a reservoir of water in a place where there is a flood everywhere. Again; in verse 33 of chapter IV; it is said All actions in their entirety; O Arjuna; culminate in knowledge. Vedanta; therefore;
which imparts knowledge of the Self; is the end of action. A liberated sage who has attained the knowledge of the Self in accordance with the instructions laid down in the Vedanta becomes a Kritakritya (one who has done everything and has nothing more to do).
