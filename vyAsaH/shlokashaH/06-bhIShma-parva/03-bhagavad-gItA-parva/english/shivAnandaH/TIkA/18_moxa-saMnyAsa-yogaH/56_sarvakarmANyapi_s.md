If by chance he commits some prohibited actions; still; as in the Ganga
(Indias most holy river) the waters of the drains and roads find union;
so My devotee; becoming united with Me; is unaffected by these prohibited actions.Worship of the Lord through ones duties purifies the heart of the aspirant and prepares him for the devotion to knowledge which eventually leads him to the attainment of Selfrealisation. The Yoga of Devotion is eulogised here.All actions Good actions and even the prohibited actions. He who takes shelter in Me; Vaasudeva; the Lord;
with his whole self centred in Me attains the eternal abode of Vishnu;
by the grace of the Lord.
