Why do you then make a distinction in actions by saying whatever action a man does by the body; speech and mindOur answer is In the performance of every action; one of the three -- body; speech or mind --
has a more prominent share than the others while seeing; hearing and other activities which accompany or go along with life are subordinate to that one.Therefore all actions are classified under three groups and are spoken of as done by the body or speech or mind. The fruit of an actions also is enjoyed through the body; speech and mind and one of the three takes a more prominent share than the rest. Therefore; it is proper to say Whatever action a man performs with his body; speech and mind৷৷.
