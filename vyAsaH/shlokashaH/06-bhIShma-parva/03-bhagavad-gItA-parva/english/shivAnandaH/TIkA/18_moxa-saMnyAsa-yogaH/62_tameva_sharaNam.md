18.62 तम् to Him; एव even; शरणम् गच्छ take refuge; सर्वभावेन with all thy being; भारत O Bharata; तत्प्रसादात् by His grace; पराम् supreme;
शान्तिम् peace; स्थानम् the abode; प्राप्स्यसि (thou) shalt obtain;
शाश्वतम् eternal.Commentary Do total and perfect surrender to the Lord.
Do not keep any secret desires for silent gratification. Desire and egoism are the two chief obstacles that stand in the way of selfsurrender. Kill them ruthlessly.Run to the Lord for shelter with all thy being for freeing thyself from the troubles; afflictions and sorrows of Samsara. Take the Lord as the sole refuge. Then by His grace; thou shalt obtain supreme peace and attain to the supreme; eternal Abode.
