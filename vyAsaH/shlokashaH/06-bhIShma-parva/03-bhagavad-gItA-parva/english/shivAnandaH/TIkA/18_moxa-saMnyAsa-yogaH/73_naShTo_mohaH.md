It is the cause of the whole evil of Samsara. It is as hard to cross as the ocean.Smritih I have attained knowledge of the true nature of the Self. The whole aim of Sadhana or spiritual practice and the study of scriptures is the annihilation of delusion and the attainment of the knowledge of the Self. When one gets it; the three knots or ties of ignorance; viz.; ignorance; delusion (desire) and action are destroyed; all the doubts are cleared; and all the Karmas are destroyed.To him who beholds the Self in all beings; what delusion is there; what grief (Isavasya Upanishad; 7)I shall do Thy word Arjuna means to say; I am firm in Thy ;nd. Through Thy grace I have achieved the end of life. I have nothing more to do.
