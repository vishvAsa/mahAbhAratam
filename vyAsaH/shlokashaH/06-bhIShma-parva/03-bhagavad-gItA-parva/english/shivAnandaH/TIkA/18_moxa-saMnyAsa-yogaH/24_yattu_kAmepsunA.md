18.24 यत् which; तु but; कामेप्सुना by one longing for desires; कर्म
action; साहङ्कारेण with egoism; वा or; पुनः again; क्रियते is performed;
बहुलायासम् with much effort; तत् that; राजसम् Rajasic (passionate);
उदाहृतम् is declared.Commentary A passionate man performs various selfish actions. He boasts of his actions in public. Passion prompts him to do them. He can never work without expectation of a reward.Kamepsuna;
phalepsuna The Rajasic or passionate man expects pleasures as fruits of action. A liberated sage alone is absolutely free from egoism. He will not dream even of a reward for the action; because all his desires are gratified when he realises Brahman. He is an Aptakama. (Aptakamasya ka spriha) How can there be longing or craving in a sage in whom all desires are gratified or burnt by the fire of SelfknowledgeEven the performer of a pure act; who has no knowledge of the Self is egoistic.
If such be the case; the Rajasic and Tamasic workers are much more egoistic. In worldly parlance we speak of a learned Pundit This Pundit is a very modest; unassuming; and egoless Brahmana.Now listen; O Arjuna;
to the characteristics of action that is of darkness.
