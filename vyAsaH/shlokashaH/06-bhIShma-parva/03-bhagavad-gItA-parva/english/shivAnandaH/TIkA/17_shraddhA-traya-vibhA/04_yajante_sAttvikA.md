tells Arjuna how this faith determines the object of worship. The nature of the faith (whether it is Sattvic; Rajasic or Tamasic) has to be inferred from its characteristic effects; viz.; the worship of the gods and the like. Each man selects his object of worship according to the ruling Guna of his being. The expression of a mans faith depends on the Guna that is predominant in him. A Sattvic man will give his faith the Sattvic expression; a Rajasic man the Rajasic expression and a Tamasic man the Tamasic expression.Sattvic persons or people with Sattvic faith who are devoted to the worship of the gods; are rare in this world.Yakshas are the brothers of Kubera; the lord of wealth gnomes; the spirits that guard wealth.Rakshasas Beings of strength and power such as Nairrita demons giants gifted with illusive powers.Bhutas Ghosts.
