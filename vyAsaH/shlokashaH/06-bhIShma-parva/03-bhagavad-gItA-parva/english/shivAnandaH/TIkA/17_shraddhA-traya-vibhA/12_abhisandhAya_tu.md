17.12 अभिसंधाय seeking for; तु indeed; फलम् fruit; दम्भार्थम् for ostentation; अपि also; च and; एव even; यत् which; इज्यते is offered;
भरतश्रेष्ठ O best of the Bharatas; तम् that; यज्ञम् sacrifice; विद्धि
know; राजसम् Rajasic.Commentary If anyone performs a sacrifice in order to obtain; heaven; son; wealth; or name and fame; then it is a sacrifice of a Rajasic nature. The performer of this kind of sacrifice has the motive of increasing his own importance; for popularising his own name in the world; for gaining some reward; for showing himself off as a great; pious and learned man; for making an exhibition of his riches for his own glorificaion. He has no aspiration for attaining the knowledge of the Self.
