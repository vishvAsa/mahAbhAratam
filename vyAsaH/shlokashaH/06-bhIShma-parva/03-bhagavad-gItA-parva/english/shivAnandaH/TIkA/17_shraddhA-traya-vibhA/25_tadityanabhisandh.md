The sages and the aspirants meditate on Tat. They utter the word Tat and say; May all our actions and the fruits of them be in the name of Tat (That or Brahman).Thus they offer all actions and their fruits to Brahman and practise renunciation.
They are freed from egoism and the bondage of Karma. They attain Selfrealisation through purity of heart caused by selfless; motiveless and desireless actions.The actions that is ennobled and sanctified by uttering Om at the beginning and which is offered to That is transformed into the nature of Brahman. All actions in their entirety; O Arjuna;
culminate in wisdom (IV.33). He who does the actions with the spirit of sacrifice becomes Brahman eventually.Tat is symbolic of the presentation of all the fruits of all such activities to Brahman. If you utter Tat;
it is tantamount to saying; They are nt mine. What has been begun with Om is given away to Brahman with the utterance of Tat.The use of Sat is described in the following verse.
