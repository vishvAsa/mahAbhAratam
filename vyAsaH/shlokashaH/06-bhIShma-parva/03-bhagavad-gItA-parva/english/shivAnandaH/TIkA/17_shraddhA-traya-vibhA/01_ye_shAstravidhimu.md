setting aside; यजन्ते perform sacrifice; श्रद्धया with faith; अन्विताः
endowed; तेषाम् their; निष्ठा condition; तु verily; का what; कृष्ण O Krishna; सत्त्वम् Sattva; आहो or; रजः Rajas; तमः Tamas.Commentary This chapter deals with the three kinds of people who are endowed with three kinds of faith. Each of them follows a path in accordance with his inherent nature -- either Sattvic; Rajasic or Tamasic.Arjuna says to Krishna It is very difficult to grasp the meaning of the scriptures. It is still more difficult to get a spiritual preceptor who can teach the scriptures. The vast majority of persons are not endowed with a pure;
subtle; sharp and onepointed intellect. The span of life is short. The scriptures are endless. The obstacles on the spiritual path are many.
Facilities for learning are not always available.There are conflicting statements in the scriptures which have to be reconciled. Thou hast said that liberation is not possible without a knowledge of the scriptures.
An ordinary man; though ignorant of or unable to follow this teaching;
does charity; performs rituals; worships the Lord with faith; tries to follow the footsteps of sages and saints just as a child copies letters that have been written out for him as a model; or as a blind man makes hiw way by the aid of another who possesses sight. What faith is his How should the state of such a man be described -- Sattvic; Rajasic or Tamasic What is the fate of the believers who have no knowledge of the scriptures
