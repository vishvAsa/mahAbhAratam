restored.Commentary Arjuna says to Lord Krishna O Lord; I now behold Thy human form. Now my thoughts are collected and I am serene. I can speak.
My senses perform their proper functions. My fear has vanished. Thou hast treated me as a mother would treat her erring child whom she embraces and nurses. Just as the calf rejoices when it beholds its mother who was missing for some days; so also I rejoice now when I behold Thy gentle form. I have drunk the nectar. Now I am alive.
