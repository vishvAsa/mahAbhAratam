11.43 पिता Father; असि (Thou) art; लोकस्य of the world; चराचरस्य of the moving and unmoving; त्वम् Thou; अस्य of this; पूज्यः to be reserved; च
and; गुरुः the Guru; गरीयान् weightier; न not; त्वत्समः eal to Thee;
अस्ति is; अभ्यधिकः surpassing; कुतः whence; अन्यः other; लोकत्रये in the three worlds; अपि also; अप्रतिमप्रभाव O Being of unealled power.Commentary There exists none who is eal to Thee There cannot be two or more Isvaras. If there were; the world will not get on as it does now. All the Isvaras may not be of one mind; as they would all be independent of one another. What one wishes to create; another may wish to destroyWhen there does not exist one who is eal to Thee; how could there be one superior to TheeFather Creator. As the Lord is the creator of this world He is fit to be adored. He is the greatest Guru also.
Therefore there is no one who is eal to the Lord.
