present and future; but is not limited by time and space. Therefore He has neither a beginning nor middle nor end.Arjuna could have this divine vision only with the help of the divine eye bestowed upon him by the Lord. He who has supreme devotion to the Lord and on whom the Lord showers His grace can enjoy this wondrous vision.
