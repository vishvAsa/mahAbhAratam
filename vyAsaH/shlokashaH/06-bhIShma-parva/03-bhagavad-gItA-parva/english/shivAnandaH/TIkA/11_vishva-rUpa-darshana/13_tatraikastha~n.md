11.13 तत्र there; एकस्थम् resting in one; जगत् the universe; कृत्स्नम्
the whole; प्रविभक्तम् divided; अनेकधा in many groups; अपश्यत् saw;
देवदेवस्य of the God of gods; शरीरे in the body; पाण्डवः son of Pandu;
तदा then.Commentary Tatra There -- in the Cosmic Form.Anekadha Many groups -- gods; manes; men and other species of beings.Arjuna beheld all forms as the forms of the Lord; all heads as His heads; all eyes as His eyes; all hands as His hands; all feet as His feet; every part of every body as the limb of the Lords divine form. Wherever he looked he beheld nothing but the Lord. He got mystic divine knowledge.Sanjaya has given a truly graphic description of the Cosmic Form. Yet; it would be futile to grasp it with the finite mind. It is a transcendental vision; beyond the reach of the mind and senses. It has to be realised in Samadhi.
