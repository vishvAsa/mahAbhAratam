11.11 दिव्यमाल्याम्बरधरम् wearing divine garlands (necklaces) and apparel; दिव्यगन्धानुलेपनम् anointed with divine unguents;
सर्वाश्चर्यमयम् the allwonderful; देवम् resplendent; अनन्तम् endless;
विश्वतोमुखम् with faces on all sides.Commentary Visvatomukham With faces on all sides; as He is the Self of all beings.Devam God. Also means resplendent.Anantam Endless. He Who is free from the three kinds of limitations; viz.; DesaKalaVastuPariccheda (limitations of space; time;
and thing respectively) is Anantam. He is Brahman. This philosophical concept is explained below.The pot is here. This is spacelimitatio. The pot is now here. This is timelimitation. The pot is not a cloth. This is thing(material) limitation. There is saffron in Kashmir only. This is limitation of space and thing. You can have apples only in September.
This is limitation of time and thing. But Brahman is everywhere; as It is allpervading. It exists in the past; the present and the future. It dwells in all parts. Hence It is beyond these three limitations. It is therefore endless.
