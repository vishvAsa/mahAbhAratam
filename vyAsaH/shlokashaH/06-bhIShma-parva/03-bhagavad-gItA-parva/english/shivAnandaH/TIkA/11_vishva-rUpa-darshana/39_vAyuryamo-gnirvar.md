प्रजापतिः Prajapati; त्वम् Thou; प्रपितामहः greatgrandfather; च and;
नमःनमः salutations; ते to Thee; अस्तु be; सहस्रकृत्वः thousand times;
पुनः again; च and; भूयः again; अपि also ; नमःनमः salutations; ते to Thee.Commentary Prajapati Marichi and others were the seven mindborn sons of Brahma. Kasyapa descended from Marichi and from Kasyapa came all other progeny. Therefore; Marichi; Kasyapa and others are known as Prajapatis or the gods or progeny. The word Prajapati here is interpreted by some as Kasyapa and other Prajapatis. But as the word has been used here in the singular number it is appropriate to take Brahma as Prajapati. Brahma is the grandfather (Pitamaha) of Kasyapa. Brahma or the Hiranyagarbha is the Karya Brahman (effect). Isvara is the Karana Brahman (the cause for Brahma). Therefore; Isvara is the greatgrandfather. He is the father of,even Brahma.Isvara has Maya as the limiting adjunct. Maya is His causal body. Isvara has no plane. Maya is in an undifferentiated state. She is in a state where the alities of Nature (Gunas) are in eilibrium. When the eilibrium is disturbed through the will of Isvara; the three Gunas; Brahma; Vishnu and Siva manifest.Thou art the moon alludes to and includes the sun also.Punah;
Bhuyah Again. Salutations a thousand times and again salutations. This indicates that Arjuna had intense faith in and boundless devotion for Lord Krishna. He was not satisfied even if he prostrated himself a thousand times.
