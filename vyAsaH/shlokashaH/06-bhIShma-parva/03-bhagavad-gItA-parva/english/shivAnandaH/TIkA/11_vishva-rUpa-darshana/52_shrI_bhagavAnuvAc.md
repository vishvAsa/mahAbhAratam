11.52 सुदुर्दर्शम् very hard to see; इदम् this; रूपम् form; दृष्टवानसि
thou hast seen; यत् which; मम My; देवाः gods; अपि also; अस्य (of) this;
रूपस्य of form; नित्यम् ever; दर्शनकाङ्क्षिणः (are) desrious to behold.Commentary Lord Krishna says to Arjuna Though the gods long to behold the Cosmic Form yet they have not seen it as you have done. THey can never behold it.Just as the Chataka (a bird) longs for a drop of rain; eagerly turning its eyes towards the clouds; so also do gods yearn to behold the Cosmic Form but their wishes have not been gratified even in their dreams. Such is that marvellous vision which thou hast easily seen.
