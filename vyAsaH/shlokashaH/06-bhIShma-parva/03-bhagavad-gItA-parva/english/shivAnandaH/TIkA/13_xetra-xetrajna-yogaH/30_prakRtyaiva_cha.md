13.30 प्रकृत्या by Nature; एव alone; च and; कर्माणि actions; क्रियमाणानि
being performed; सर्वशः all; यः who; पश्यति sees; तथा so also; आत्मानम्
the Self; अकर्तारम् actionless; सः he; पश्यति sees.Commentary Nature is responsible for all activities. The Self is beyond all action. It is the silent witness only. He who experiences thus is the real seer or sage.He who knows that all actions proceeding from the five organs of knowledge;
the five organs of action; the mind and the intellect are prompted by Nature and that the Self is actionless; really sees. He alone sees. He who identifies himself with the body; the mind and the senses and foolishly thinks that the Self is the actor is an ignorant man. He sees only with the physical eyes. He has no inner eye of intuition. The sky remains motionless but the clouds move across the sky. Even so the Self is actionless but Nature does everythin. The Self is destitute of any limiting adjunct. Just as there is no variety in ether; so also there is no variety in the Self. It is one homogeneous essence. It is free from any kind of characteristics. (Cf.III.27XIV.19XVIII.16)
