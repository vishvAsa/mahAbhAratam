13.10 असक्तिः nonattachment; अनभिष्वङ्गः nonidentification of the Self;
पुत्रदारगृहादिषु in son; wife; home and the rest; नित्यम् constant; च
and;समचित्तत्वम् evenmindedness; इष्टानिष्टोपपत्तिषु on the attainment of the desirable and the undesirable.Commentary When a man thinks; This object is mine; the idea of mineness enters his mind. He develops Abhimana (false identification). Then he begins to love the objects. He clings to them and gets attached to them. Asakti is nonattachment to objects. There is absence of liking for the objects.Anabhishvangah There is intense attachment to wife; son or mother; etc. There is complete identification of the Self with another. He feels happy or miserable when that person is happy or miserable. Govindan feels miserable when his wife is dead because he was very much attached to her but he does not feel anything when his neighbours wife is dead. A man of wisdom has no attachment to his home. He considers his home as a public inn on the side of a public road.And the rest Others who are very dear relatives or other dependants.Constant evenmindedness or eanimity is an index of knowledge. The man of wisdom is neither elated when he gets the desirable or pleasant objects; nor grieves when he attains the undesriable or painful objects.Nonattachment; absence of affection and eanimity are all conducive to the attainment of knowledge of the Self.
They are designated as knowledge because they are the means of attaining knowledge.
