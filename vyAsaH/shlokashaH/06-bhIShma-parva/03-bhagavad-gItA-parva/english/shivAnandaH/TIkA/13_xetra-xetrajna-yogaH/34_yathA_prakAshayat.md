भारत O descendant of Bharata (Arjuna).Commentary The Supreme Self is one. It illumines the whole matter from the Unmanifested down to the blade of grass or a lump of clay; from the great elements down to firmness or fortitude. (Cf. verses 5 and 6.) Just as the sun is one;
just as the sun illumines the whole world; just as the sun is not tainted; so also the Self is One in all bodies; It illumines all the bodies and It is not contaminated.
