the field; इति thus; अभिधीयते is called; एतत् this; यः who; वेत्ति
knows; तम् him; प्राहुः (they) call; क्षेत्रज्ञः the knower of the field; इति thus; तद्विदः the knowers of that.Commentary Kshetra literally means field. The body is so called because the fruits
(harvest) of actions in the form of pleasure and pain are reaped in it as in a field. The physical; the mental and the causal bodies go to constitute the totality of the field. It is not the physical body alone that forms the field.He who knows the field and he who beholds it as distinct from himself through knowledge is the knower of the field or matter.Those who know them The sages.
