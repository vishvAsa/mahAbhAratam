7.5 अपरा lower; इयम् this; इतः from this; तु but; अन्याम् different;
प्रकृतिम् nature; विद्धि know; मे My; पराम् higher; जीवभूताम् the very lifeelement; महाबाहो O mightyarmed; यया by which; इदम् this; धार्यते is upheld; जगत् world.Commentary The eightfold Nature described in the previous verse is the inferior Nature. It constitutes the Kshetra or the field or matter. It is impure. It generates evil and causes bondage. But the superior Nature is pure. It is My very Self; Kshetrajna (knower of the field or Spirit) by which life is sustained; and that which enters within the whole world and upholds it. It is the very lifeelement or the principle of Selfconsciousness; by which this universe is sustained.
