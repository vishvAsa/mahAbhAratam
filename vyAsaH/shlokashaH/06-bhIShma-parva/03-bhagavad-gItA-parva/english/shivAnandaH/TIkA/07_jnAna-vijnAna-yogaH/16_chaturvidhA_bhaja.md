सुकृतिनः virtuous; अर्जुन O Arjuna; आर्तः the distressed; जिज्ञासुः the seeker of knowledge; अर्थार्थी the seeker of wealth; ज्ञानी the wise; च
and; भरतर्षभ O lord of the Bharatas.Commentary The distressed is he who is suffering from a chronic and incurable disease; he whose life is in jeopardy on account of earthake; volcanic eruption; thunder; attack by a dacoit or enemy or tiger; etc. When Draupadi and Gajendra were in great distress they worshipped the Lord. These are the instances of Aarta Bhakti.Jijnasu is the enirer. He is dissatisfied with this world. There is a void in his life. He always feels that sensual pleasure is not the highest form of happiness and there is yet pure eternal bliss unmixed with grief and pain; which is to be found within. Janaka and Uddhava were devotees of this type.Seeker of wealth is he who craves for money;
wife; children; position; name and fame. Sugriva; Vibhishana; Upamanyu and Dhruva were all devotees of this type.The wise are the men of knowledge who have attained to Selfillumination. Sukadeva was a JnaniBhakta.Kamsa; Sishupala and Ravana thought of the Lord constantly on account of fear and hatred (VairaBhakti). Hence they are also regarded as devotees.Be devoted to God; whatever be your motive.
Devotion will purify the motive in due course.
