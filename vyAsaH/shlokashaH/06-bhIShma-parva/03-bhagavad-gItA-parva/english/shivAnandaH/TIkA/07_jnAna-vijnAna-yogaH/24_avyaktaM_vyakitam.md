7.24 अव्यक्तम् the unmanifested; व्यक्तिम् to manifestation; आपन्नम्
come to; मन्यन्ते think; माम् Me; अबुद्धयः the foolish; परम् the highest; भावम् nature; अजानन्तः not knowing; मम My; अव्ययम् immutable;
अनुत्तमम् most excellent.Commentary The ignorant take Lord Krishna as a common mortal. They think that He has taken a body like ordinary human beings from the unmanifested state on account of the force of Karma of the previous birth. They have no knowledge of His higher; imperishable and selfluminous nature as the Highest Self. They think that He has just now come into manifestation; though He is selfexistent; eternal;
beginningless; endless; birthless; deathless; changeless; infinite and unmanifest.
