7.28 येषाम् of whom; तु but; अन्तगतम् is at the end; पापम् sin; जनानाम्
of men; पुण्यकर्मणाम् of men of virtuous deeds; ते they;
द्वन्द्वमोहनिर्मुक्ताः freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites; भजन्ते worship; माम् Me; दृढव्रताः men steadfast in vows.Commentary By the performance of good deeds the heart is slowly purified Sattva increases Rajas and Tamas are gradually thinned out. The mind becomes serene and calm. The little selfarrogating personality slowly dies. You grow in spirituality. The divine flame becomes brighter and brighter. You become impersonal.Sin To forget ones identity with the Supreme Soul is the greatest sin. To see difference is sin. To take the body as the Self; to believe that this world is real is sin. Selfishness is sin. Egoism is sin. Ignorance is sin.Steadfast in vows The man steadfast in vows entertains a firm resolve I must realise the Self now I will not budge an inch from my seat till I attain Selfrealisation. He has the firm conviction that Brahman is the only Reality. This world is unreal. It is like a mirage. I can attain immortality and eternal bliss if I realise the Self only. There is not an iota of happiness in the sensual objects. Therefore the Lord says; Those persons of pure deeds worship Me steadfast in vows.
