remains.Commentary Jnanam is Paroksha Jnanam or indirect knowledge of Brahman obtained through the study of the Upanishads. Vijnanam is Visesha Jnanam; i.e.; Aparoksha Jnanam obtained through direct Selfrealisation (intuitional wisdom).In this verse the Lord praises knowledge in order to make Arjuna follow His instruction closely with rapt attention; faith and interest. The Lord says I shall teach thee in full. You will attain to omniscience or perfect knowledge of the Self;
after knowing which nothing more remains to be known here. If anyone attains the knowledge of the Self; he will know everything. That is the reason why Saunaka; the great householder; approacehd Angirasa respectfully and asked What is that; O Lord; which being known all this becomes known (Cf.XIII.11)
