7.30 साधिभूताधिदैवम् with the Adhibhuta and the Adhidaiva together; माम्
Me; साधियज्ञम् with the Adhiyajna; च and; ये who; विदुः know; प्रयाणकाले
at the time of death; अपि even; च and; माम् Me; ते they; विदुः know;
युक्तचेतसः steadfast in mind.Commentary They who are steadfast in mind;
who have taken refuge in Me; who know Me as the knowledge of elements in the physical plane; as the knowledge of the gods in the celestial or mental plane; as the knowledge of the sacrifice in the realm of sacrifice; are not affected by death. They do not lose their memory.
They continue to keep up the consciousness of Me even at the time of their departure from this world. Those who worship Me along with these three know Me even at the time of death. (Cf.VIII.25)(This chapter is known by the names Vijnana Yoga and Jnana Yoga also.)Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita; the Science of the Eternal;
the scripture of Yoga; the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna; ends the seventh discourse entitledThe Yoga of Wisdom and Realisation. ,
