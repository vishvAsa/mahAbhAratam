7.19 बहूनाम् of many; जन्मनाम् of births; अन्ते in the end; ज्ञानवान्
the wise; माम् to Me; प्रपद्यते approaches; वासुदेवः Vaasudeva; सर्वम्
all; इति thus; सः he; महात्मा the great soul; सुदुर्लभः (is) very hard to find.Commentary Vaasudeva is a name of Lord Krishna as He is the son of Vasudeva. He is the allpervading Brahman.The aspirant gradually evolves through Yogic practices; selfless service; devotion and constant meditation in many births and ultimately attains the inner Self. He realises that all is Vaasudeva. It is very difficult to find such a great soul; who has attained to perfection. No one is eal to him. That is the reason why the Lord has said; One in a thousand perchance strives for perfection even among those successful strivers; only one perchance knows Me in essence. (Cf.VII.3.)
