7.15 न not; माम् to Me; दुष्कृतिनः evildoers; मूढाः the deluded;
प्रपद्यन्ते seek; नराधमाः the lowest of men;,मायया by Maya; अपहृतज्ञानाः
deprived of knowledge; आसुरम् belonging to demons; भावम् nature;
आश्रिताः having taken to.Commentary These three kinds of people have no discrimination between right and wrong; the Real and the unreal. They commit murder; robbery; theft and other kinds of atrocious actions. They speak untruth and injure others in a variety of ways. Those who follow the ways of the demons take the body as the Self like Vivochana and worship it with flowers; scents; unguents; nice clothes and palatable foods of various sorts. They are deluded souls. They try to nourish their body and do various sorts of evil actions to attain this end.
Therefore they do not worship Me. Ignorance is the root cause of all these evils. (Cf.XVI.16and20)
