अस्ति is; धनञ्जय O Dhananjaya; मयि in Me; सर्वम् all; इदम् this; प्रोतम्

This illustration of gems and thread illustrates only the idea that all beings and the whole world are threaded on the Lord. The thread is not the cause of the gems. As Brahman is all in all there is nothing whatever higher than It.
