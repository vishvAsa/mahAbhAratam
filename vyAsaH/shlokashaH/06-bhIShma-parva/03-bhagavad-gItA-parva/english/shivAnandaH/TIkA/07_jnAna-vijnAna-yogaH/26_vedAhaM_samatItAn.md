7.26 वेद know; अहम् I; समतीतानि the past; वर्तमानानि the present; च and;
अर्जुन O Arjuna; भविष्याणि the future; च and; भूतानि beings; माम् Me; तु
verily; वेद knows; न not; कश्चन any one.Commentary Persons who are deluded by the three alities of Nature do not know the Lord. As they lack in the knowledge of His real nature; they do not adore Hi. But the Lord knows through His omniscience the beings of the past; the present and the future. He who worships the Lord with singleminded devotion knows Him in essence. He has knowledge of His real nature.
