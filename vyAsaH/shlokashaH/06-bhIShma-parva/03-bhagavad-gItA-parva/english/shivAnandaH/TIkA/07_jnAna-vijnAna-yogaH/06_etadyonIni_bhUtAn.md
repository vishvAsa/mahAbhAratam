also.Commentary These two Natures; the inferior and the superior; are the womb of all beings. As I am the source of these two Prakritis or Natures also; I am the cause of this universe. The whole universe originates from Me and dissolves in Me.In the Brahma Sutras (chapter 1;
section 1; aphorism 2) it is said; Janmadyasya yatah meaning that Brahman is that omniscient and omnipotent cause from which proceed the origin; subsistence and dissolution of this world.Just as the mind is the material cause and also the seer (Drashta) for the objects seen in a dream; so also Isvara is the material cause of this world
(UpadanaKarana) and also the seer (Drashta). He is also the efficient or the instrumental cause (NimittaKarana). (Cf.XIV.3)
