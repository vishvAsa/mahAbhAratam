4.41 योगसंन्यस्तकर्माणम् one who has renounced actions by Yoga;
ज्ञानसंछिन्नसंशयम् one whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge;
आत्मवन्तम् possessing the self; न not; कर्माणि actions; निबध्नन्ति bind;
धनञ्जय O Dhananjaya.Commentary Sri Madhusudana Sarasvati explains Atmavantam as always watchful.He who has attained to Selfrealisation renounces all actions by means of Yoga or the knowledge of Brahman. As he is established in the knowledge of the identity of the individual soul with the,Supreme Soul; all his doubts are cut asunder. Actions do not bind him as they are burnt in the fire of wisdom and as he is always watchful over himself. (Cf.II.48III.9IV.20)
