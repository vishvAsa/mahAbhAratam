4.11 ये who; यथा in whatever way; माम् Me; प्रपद्यन्ते approach; तान्
them; तथा so; एव even; भजामि reward; अहम् I; मम My; वर्त्म path;
अनुवर्तन्ते follow; मनुष्याः men; पार्थ O Partha; सर्वशः in all ways.Commentary I reward men by bestowing on them the objects they desire in accordance with their ways and the motives with which they seek Me. If anyone worships Me with selfish motives I grant him the objects he desires. If he worships Me unselfishly for attaining knowledge of the Self; I grant him Moksha or final liberation. I am not at all partial to anyone. (Cf.VII.21andIX.23).
