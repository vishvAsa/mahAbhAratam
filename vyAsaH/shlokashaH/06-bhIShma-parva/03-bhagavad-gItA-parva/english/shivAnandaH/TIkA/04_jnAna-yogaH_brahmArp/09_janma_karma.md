4.9 जन्म birth; कर्म action; च and; मे My; दिव्यम् divine; एवम् thus; यः
who; वेत्ति knows; तत्त्वतः in true light; त्यक्त्वा having abandoned;
देहम् the body; पुनः again; जन्म birth; नः not; एति gets; माम् to Me;
एति comes; सः he; अर्जुन O Arjuna.Commentary The Lord; though apparently born; is always beyond birth and death though apparently active for firmly establishing righteousness; He is ever beyond all actions. He who knows this is never born again. He attains knowledge of the Self and becomes liberated while living.The birth of the Lord is an illusion. It is Aprakrita (beyond the pale of Nature). It is divine. It is peculiar to the Lord. Though He appears in human form; His body is Chinmaya (full of consciousness; not inert matter as are human bodies composed of the five elements).
