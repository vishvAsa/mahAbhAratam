4.12 काङ्क्षन्तः those who long for; कर्मणाम् of actions; सिद्धिम्
success; यजन्ते sacrifice; इह in this world; देवताः gods; क्षिप्रम्
ickly; हि because; मानुषे in the human; लोके (in the) world; सिद्धिः
success; भवति is attained; कर्मजा born of action.Commentary It is very difficult to attain to the knowledge of the Self or Selfrealisation. It demans perfect renunciation. The aspirnat should possess the four means and many other virtues; and practise constant and intense meditaion. But worldly success can be attained ickly and easily.
