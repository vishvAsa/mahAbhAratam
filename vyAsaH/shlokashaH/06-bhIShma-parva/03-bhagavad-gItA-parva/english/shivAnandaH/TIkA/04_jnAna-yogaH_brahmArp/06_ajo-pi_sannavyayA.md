भूतानाम् of beings; ईश्वरः the Lord; अपि also; सन् being; प्रकृतिम्
Nature; स्वाम् My own; अधिष्ठाय governing; संभवामि come into being;
आत्ममायया by My own Maya.Commentary Man is bound by Karma. So he takes birth. He is under the clutches of Nature. He,is deluded by the three alities of Nature whereas the Lord has Maya under His perfect control.
He rules over Nature; and so He is not under the thraldom of the alities o Nature. He appears to be born and embodied through His own Maya or illusory power; but is not so in reality. His embodiment is ; as a matter of fact; apparent; It cannot affect in the least His true divine nature. (Cf.IX.8).
