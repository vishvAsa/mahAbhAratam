knowledge; लब्ध्वा having obtained; पराम् supreme; शान्तिम् to peace;
अचिरेण at once; अधिगच्छति attains.Commentary He who is full of faith;
who constantly serves his Guru and hears his teachings; who has subdued the senses surely gets the knowledge and ickly attains the supreme peace or salvation (Moksha).
