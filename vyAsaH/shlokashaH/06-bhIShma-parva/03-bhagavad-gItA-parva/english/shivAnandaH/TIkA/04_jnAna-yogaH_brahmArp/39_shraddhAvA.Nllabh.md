4.39 श्रद्धावान् the man of faith; लभते obtains; ज्ञानम् knowledge;
तत्परः devoted; संयतेन्द्रियः who has subdued the senses; ज्ञानम्
knowledge; लब्ध्वा having obtained; पराम् supreme; शान्तिम् to peace;
अचिरेण at once; अधिगच्छति attains.Commentary He who is full of faith;
who constantly serves his Guru and hears his teachings; who has subdued the senses surely gets the knowledge and ickly attains the supreme peace or salvation (Moksha). All the above three alifications are indispensable for an aspirant if he wants to attain to the supreme peace of the Eternal ickly. One alifiaction alone will not suffice.
