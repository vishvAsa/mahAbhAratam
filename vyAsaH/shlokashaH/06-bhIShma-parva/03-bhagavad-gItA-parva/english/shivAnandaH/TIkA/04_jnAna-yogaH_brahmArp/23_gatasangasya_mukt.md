4.23 गतसङ्गस्य one who is devoid of attachment; मुक्तस्य of the liberated; ज्ञानावस्थितचेतसः whose mind is established in knowledge;
यज्ञाय for sacrifice; आचरतः acting; कर्म action; समग्रम् whole;
प्रविलीयते is dissolved.Commentary One who is free from attachment; who is liberated from the bonds of Karma; whose mind is centred and rooted in wisdom; who performs actions for the sake of sacrifice; in order to please the Lord -- all his actions with their results melt away. His actions are reduced to nothing. They are; in fact; no actions at all.
