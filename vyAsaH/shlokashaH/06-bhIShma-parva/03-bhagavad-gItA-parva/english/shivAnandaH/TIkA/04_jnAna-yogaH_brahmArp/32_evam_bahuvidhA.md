4.32 एवम् thus; बहुविधाः manifold; यज्ञाः sacrifices; वितताः are spread;
ब्रह्मणः of Brahman (or of the Veda); मुखे in the face; कर्मजान् born of action; विद्धि know (thou); तान् them; सर्वान् all; एवम् thus; ज्ञात्वा
having known; विमोक्ष्यसे thou shalt be liberated.Commentary The word Brahmanah has also been interpreted to mean In the Vedas.Various kinds of sacrifices are spread out at the mouth of Brahman; i.e.; they are known from the Vedas. Know that they are born of action; because the Self is beyond action. If you realise that these actions do not concern me; they are not my actin; and I am actionless; you will surely be liberated from the bondage of Samsara by this right knowledge.
(Cf.IX.27XIII.15)
