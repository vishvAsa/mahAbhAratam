4.21 निराशीः without hope; यतचित्तात्मा one with the mind and self controlled; त्यक्तसर्वपरिग्रहः having abandoned all covetousness;
शारीरम् bodily; केवलम् merely; कर्म action; कुर्वन् doing; न not;
आप्नोति obtains; किल्बिषम् sin.Commentary The liberated sage renounces all actions except what is necessary for the bare maintenance of the body. He has abandoned all possessions. He incurs no sin which will cause evil effects. For a man who thirsts for liberation (Mumukshu) even righteous activity (Dharma) is a sin as it causes bondage to Samsara.
Dharma is a golden fetter for him. A golden fetter is also a fetter. A sage is liberated from both Dharma and Adharma; good and evil or virtue and vice. (Cf.III.7)
