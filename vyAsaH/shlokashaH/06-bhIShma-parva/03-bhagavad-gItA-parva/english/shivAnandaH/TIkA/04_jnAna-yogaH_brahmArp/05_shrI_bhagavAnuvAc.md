thy; च and; अर्जुन O Arjuna; तानि them; अहम् I; वेद know; सर्वाणि all; न
not; त्वम् thou; वेत्थ knowest; परन्तप O Parantapa.Commentary You have no intuitional knowledge. The eye of wisdom has not been opened in you on account of your past actions. So your power of vision is limited and therefore you do not know your previous births. But I know them because I am omniscient.
