4.34 तत् That; विद्धि know; प्रणिपातेन by long prostration; परिप्रश्नेन
by estion; सेवया by service; उपदेक्ष्यन्ति will instruct; ते to thee;
ज्ञानम् knowledge; ज्ञानिनः the wise; तत्त्वदर्शिनः those who have realised the Truth.Commentary Go to the teachers (those who are well versed in the scriptures dealing with Brahman or Brahmasrotris; and who are established in Brahman or Brahmanishthas). Prostrate yourself before them with profound humility and perfect devotion. Ask them estions; O venerable Guru What is the cause of bondage How can I get liberation What is the nature of ignorance What is the nature of knowledge What is the AntarangaSadhana (inward spiritual practice) for attaining Selfrealisation Serve the Guru wholeheartedly. A teacher who is versed in the scriptures (Sastras) but who has no direct Selfrealisaiton will not be able to help you in the attainment of the knowledge of the Self.
He who has knowledge of the scriptures and who is also established in Brahman will be able to instruct thee in that knowledge and help thee in the attainment of Selfrealisation. Mere prostrations alone will not do.
They may be tinged with hypocrisy. You must have perfect faith in your Guru and his teaching. You must serve him wholeheartedly with great devotion. Now hypocrisy is not possible.
