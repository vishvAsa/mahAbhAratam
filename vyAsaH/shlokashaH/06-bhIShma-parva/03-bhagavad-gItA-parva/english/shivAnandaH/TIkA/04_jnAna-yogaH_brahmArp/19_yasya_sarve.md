4.19 यस्य whose; सर्वे all; समारम्भाः undertakings; कामसङ्कल्पवर्जिताः
devoid of desires and purposes; ज्ञानाग्निदग्धकर्माणम् whose actions have been burnt by the fire of knowledge; तम् him; आहुः call; पण्डितम् a sage; बुधाः the wise.Commentary A sage performs actions only with a view to set an example to the masses. Though he works; he does nothing as he has no selfish interests; as his actions are burnt by the fire of wisdom which consists in the realisaion of inaction in action; through the knowledge of the Self or BrahmaJnana. BrahmaJnana is a mighty spiritual fire which consumes the results of all kinds of actions (Karmas); good and bad; and makes the enlightened sage ite free from the bonds of action. The sage who leads a life of perfect renunciation does only what is reired for the bare existence of his body. (Cf.III.19IV.10IV.37).
