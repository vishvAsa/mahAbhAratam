4.14 न not; माम् Me; कर्माणि actions; लिम्पन्ति taint; न not; मे to Me;
कर्मफले in the fruit of actions; स्पृहा desire; इति thus; माम् Me; यः
who; अभिजानाति knows; कर्मभिः by actions; न not; सः he; बध्यते is bound.Commentary As I have neither egoism nor desire for fruits; I am not bound by actions. Wordly people think they are the agents and they perfrom actions. They also expect fruits for their actions. So they take birth again and again. If one works without attachment; without egoism;
without expectation of fruits; he too will not be bound by actions. He will be freed from birth and death. (Cf.IX.9).
