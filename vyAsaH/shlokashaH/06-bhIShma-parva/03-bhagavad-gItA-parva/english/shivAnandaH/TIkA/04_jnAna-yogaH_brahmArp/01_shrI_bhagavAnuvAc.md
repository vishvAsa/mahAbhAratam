4.1 इमम् this; विवस्वते to Vivasvan; योगम् Yoga; प्रोक्तवान् taught;
अहम् I; अव्ययम् imperishable; विवस्वान् Vivasvan; मनवे to Manu; प्राह
taught; मनुः Manu; इक्ष्वाकवे to Ikshvaku; अब्रवीत् taught.Commentary Vivasvan means the sun. Ikshvaku was the son of Manu. Ikshvaku was the reputed ancestor of the solar dynasty of Kshatriyas.This Yoga is said to be imperishable because the result or fruit; i.e.; Moksha; that can be attained through it is imperishable.If the rulers of dominions possess a knowledge of the Yoga taught by Me in the preceding two discourses; they can protect the Brahmanas and rule their kingdom with justice. So I taught this Yoga to the Sungod in the beginning of evolution.
