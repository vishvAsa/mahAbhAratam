4.29 अपाने in the outgoing breath; जुह्वति sacrifice; प्राणम् incoming breath; प्राणे in the incoming breath; अपानम् outgoing breath; तथा thus;
अपरे others; प्राणापानगती courses of the outgoing and incoming breaths;
रुद्ध्वा restraining; प्राणायामपरायणाः solely absorbed in the restraint of breath.Commentary Some Yogis practise Puraka (inhalation); some Yogis practise Rechaka (exhalation);,and some Yogis practise Kumbhaka
(retention of breath).The five subPranas and the other Pranas are merged in the chief Prana (MukhyaPrana) by the practice of Pranayama. When the Prana is controlled; the mind also stops its wanderings and becomes steady the senses are also thinned out and merged in the Prana. It is through the vibration of Prana that the activities of the mind and the senses are kept up. If the Prana is controlled; the mind; the intellect and the senses cease to function.
