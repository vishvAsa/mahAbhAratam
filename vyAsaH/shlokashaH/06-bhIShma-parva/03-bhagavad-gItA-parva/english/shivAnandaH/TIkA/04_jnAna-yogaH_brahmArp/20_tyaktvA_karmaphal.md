4.20 त्यक्त्वा having abandoned; कर्मफलासङ्गम् attachment to the fruits of action; नित्यतृप्तः even content; निराश्रयः depending on nothing;
कर्मणि in action; अभिप्रवृत्तः engaged; अपि even; न not; एव verily;
किञ्चित् anything; करोति does; सः he.Commentary The same idea of inaction in action is repeated here to produce a deep impression on the minds of the aspirants. He who works for the wellbeing of the world and he who performs actions without egoism and attachment for the fruits; to set an example to the masses; really does nothing at all though he is ever engaged in activity; as he possesses the knowledge of the Self which is beyond all activity and as he has realised his identity with It.As Brahman the Absolute is selfcontained; all the desires are gratified if one realises the Self. He is ever satisfied and does not depend on anything; just as a man who has the favour of the king does not depend on the minister or the government official for anything.
(Cf.IV.41)
