4.27 सर्वाणि all; इन्द्रियकर्माणि functions of the senses; प्राणकर्माणि
functions of the breath (vital energy); च and; अपरे other;
आत्मसंयमयोगाग्नौ in the fire of the Yoga of selfrestraitn; जुह्वति
sacrifice; ज्ञानदीपिते kindled by knowledge.Commentary Just as a lamp is kindled by oil; so also the fire of the Yoga of selfcontrol is kindled by knowledge. When the Yogi concentrates or fixes his mind on Brahman or the Self; the senses and the breath cease to function. The senses and the breath are absorbed into their cause.
