4.10 वीतरागभयक्रोधाः freed from attachment; fear and anger; मन्मयाः
absorbed in Me; माम् Me; उपाश्रिताः taking refuge in; बहवः many;
ज्ञानतपसा by the fire of knowledge; पूताः purified; मद्भावम् My Being;
आगताः have attained.Commentary When one gets knowledge of the Self;
attachment to senseobjects ceases. When he realises he is the constant;
indestructible; eternal Self and that change is simply a ality of the body; then he becomes fearless. When he becomes desireless; when he is free from selfishness; when he beholds the Self only everywhere; how can anger arise in himHe who takes refuge in Brahman or the Absolute becomes firmly devoted to Him. He becomes,absorbed in Him (Brahmalina or Brahmanishtha). Jnanatapas is the fire of wisdom. Just as fire burns cotton; so also this Jnanatapas burns all the latent tendencies
(Vasanas); cravings (Trishnas); mental impressions (Samskaras); sins and all actions; and purifies the aspirants. (Cf.II.56IV.19to37).
