माम् Me.Commentary Rajarshis are kings who have become saints while discharging the duties of the kingdom.It is very difficult to get a human birth which is the means of attaining the goal of life. Being born in this human body you should lead a life of devotion to the Lord. In the human body alone will you have the power to reflect (VicharaSakti);
discrimination and dispassion. Even the gods envy the human birth.This body is impermanent. It perishes soon. It brings pain of various sorts.
So give up the efforts for securing happiness and comfort for this body.
If you do not aim at Selfrealisation even after attaining a human birth;
you live in vain you are wasting your life and you are a slayer of the Self. You will again and again be caught in the wheel of birth and death.
