9.14 सततम् always; कीर्तयन्तः glorifying; माम् Me; यतन्तः striving; च
and; दृढव्रताः firm in vows; नमस्यन्तः prostrating; च and; माम् Me;
भक्त्या with devotion; नित्ययुक्ताः always steadfast; उपासते
worship.Commentary These great souls sing My glory. They do Japa
(repetition) of Pranava (Om). They study and recite the Upanishads. They hear the Srutis (the Vedas) from their spiritual preceptor; reflect and meditate on the attributeless Absolute (Nirguna Brahman). They cultivate the Sattvic virtues such as patience; mercy; cosmic love; tolerance;
forbearance; truthfulness; purity; etc. They control the senses and steady the mind. They are firm in their vows of nonviolence;
truthfulness and purity in thought; word and deed. They worship Me with great faith and devotion as the inner Self hidden in their heart. As a neophyte cannot see God face to face; he will have to worship his Guru
(spiritual preceptor) firt and regard him as God or Brahman Himself.
