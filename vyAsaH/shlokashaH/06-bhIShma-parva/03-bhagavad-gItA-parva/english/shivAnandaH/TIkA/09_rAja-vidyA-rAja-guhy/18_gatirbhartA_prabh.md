I am the witness of the good and evil actions done by the Jivas
(individuals). I am the abode wherein all living beings dwell. I am the shelter or refuge for the distressed. I relieve the sufferings of those who take shelter under Me. I am the friend; i.e.; I do good without expecting any return. I am the source of this universe. In Me the whole world is dissolved. I am the mainstay or the foundation of this world. I am the treasurehouse which living beings shall enjoy in the future. I am the imperishable see; i.e.; the cause of the origin of all beings.
Therefore; take shelter under My feet.**
