9.29 समः the same; अहम् I; सर्वभूतेषु in all beings; न not; मे to Me;
द्वेष्यः hateful; अस्ति is; न not; प्रियः dear; ये who; भजन्ति worship;
तु but; माम् Me; भक्त्या with devotion; मयि in Me; ते they; तेषु in them; च and; अपि also; अहम् I.Commentary The Lord has an even outlook towards all. He regards all living beings alike. None He has condemned;
none has He favoured. He is the enemy of none. He is the partial lover of none. He does not favour some and frown on others. The egoistic man only has created a wide gulf between himself and the Supreme Being by his wrong attitude. The Lord is closer to him that his own breath;
nearer than his hands and feet.I am like fire. Just as fire removes cold from those who draw near it but does not remove the cold from those who keep away from it; even so I bestow My grace on My devotees; but not owing to any sort of attachment on My part. Just as the light of the sun; though pervading everywhere; is reflected only in a clean mirror but not in a pot; so also I; the Supreme Lord; present everywhere;
manifest Myself only in those persons from whose minds all kinds of impurities (which have accumulated there on account of ignorance) have been removed by their devotion.The sun has neither attachment for the mirror nor hatred for the pot. The Kalpavriksha has neither hatred nor love for people. It bestows the desired objects only on those who go near it. (Cf.VII.17XII.14and20)Now hear the glory of devotion to Me.
