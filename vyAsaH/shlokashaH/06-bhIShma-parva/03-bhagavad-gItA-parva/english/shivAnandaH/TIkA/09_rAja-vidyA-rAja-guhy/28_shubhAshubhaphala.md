9.28 शुभाशुभफलैः from good and evil fruits; एवम् thus; मोक्ष्यसे (thou)
shalt be freed; कर्मबन्धनैः from the bonds of actions;
संन्यासयोगयुक्तात्मा with the mind steadfast in the Yoga of renunciation; विमुक्तः liberated; माम् to Me; उपैष्यसि (thou) shalt come.Commentary Evam Thus -- when you thus offer everything to Me.Renunciation of the fruits of all works is Sannyasa. He who is eipped with the mind steadfast in the Yog of renunciation is Sannyasayogayuktatma. The act of offering everything unto the Lord,constitutes the Yoga of renunciation. It is also Yoga as it is an action. With the mind endowed with renunciation and Yoga thou shalt be freed from good and evil results while yet living and thou shalt come unto Me when this body falls.An objector says; Then the Lord has love and hatred as He confers His grace on His devotees only and not on others.The answer is; Not so. The Lord is impartial and is beyond love and hatred. His grace flows towards all. But the devotee recieves it freely as he has opened his heart to the reception of His grace.This is explained in the next verse.
