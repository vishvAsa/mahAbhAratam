9.23 ये who; अपि even; अन्यदेवताः other gods; भक्ताः devotees; यजन्ते
worship; श्रद्धया with faith; अन्विताः endowed; ते they; अपि also; माम्
Me; एव alone; कौन्तेय O Kaunteya; यजन्ति worship; अविधिपूर्वकम् by the wrong method.Commentary They worship Me in ignorance. Their mode of worship is contrary to the ancient,rule. Hence they return to this world.People worship Agni; Indra; Surya; Varuna; the Vasus; etc. Even they attain Me; because I am everywhere. But their devotion is not pure.
It is vicarious. Water should be given to the root and not to the branches. If the root is satisfied; the whole tree must be and is satisfied. Even so; if I (the root of this world and all the gods) am satisfied; all the gods must be and are satisfied. Though the messages from the five organs of knowledge reach the one consciousness; will it be right and useful to place a sweetmeat in the ear and a flower in the eyes The function of eating must be done by the mouth alone and the function of smelling by the nose alone. Therefore I should be worshipped in My own nature. They should know Me as the Self in all beings. They should recognise Me in other worship. I am the root. I am the source of all the gods and of this whole world. (Cf.IV.11VII.20)
