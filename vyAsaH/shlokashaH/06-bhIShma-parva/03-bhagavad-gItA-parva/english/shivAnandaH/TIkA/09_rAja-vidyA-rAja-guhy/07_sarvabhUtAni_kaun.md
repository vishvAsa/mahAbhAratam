9.7 सर्वभूतानि all beings; कौन्तेय O Kaunteya; प्रकृतिम् to Nature;
यान्ति go; मामिकाम् My; कल्पक्षये at the end of the Kalpa; पुनः again;
तानि them; कल्पादौ at the beginning of the Kalpa; विसृजामि send forth;
अहम् I.Commentary Prakriti The inferior one or the lower Nature composed of the three alities; Sattva; Rajas and Tamas.Just as the grass grows from the earth and dries up in the earth; just as the ripples and waves rise from the ocean and disappear in the ocean itself; just as the dreams proceed from the mind and melt away in the mind itself when the dreamer comes back to the waking state; so also the beings which arise from Nature merge into it during dissolution or Pralaya.Pralaya is the period of dissolution. MahaUtpatti is the time of creation.
(Cf.VIII.18;19)
