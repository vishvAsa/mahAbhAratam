I.Commentary Ananyah Nonseparate. This is another interpretation.
Persons who; meditating on Me as nonseparate; worship Me in all beings
-- to them who are ever devout; I secure gain and safety. They consider themselves as nonseparate; i.e.; they look upon the Supreme Being as nonseparate from their own Self they look upon the Supreme Being as their own Self.Those devotees who behold nothing as separate from themselves have no selfish interests of their own. They certainly do not look for their own gain and safety. They have no desire for life or death. They have taken sole refuge in the Lord. They have nothing to lose; because there is nothing they call their own. Their very bodies become Gods. They have no desire for acisition because all their desires are gratified by their communion with the Lord. They have eternal satisfaction as they possess all the divine Aisvarya; the supreme wealth of the Lord.They entertain no other thoughts than those of the Lord.
Conseently the Lord Himself looks after their bodily wants; such as food and clothing (this is known as Yoga); and preserves what they already possess (this is known as Kshema). He does these two acts. Just as the father and mother attend to the bodily needs of their children; so also the Lord attends to the needs of His devotees.They direct their whole mind with full faith towards the Lord. They make the Lord alone the sole object of their thought. For them nothing is dearer in this world than the Lord. They live for the Lord alone. They think of Him only with singeleness of purpose and onepointed devotion. They behold nothing but the Lord. They love Him in all creatures. When they lead such a life;
the Lord takes the whole burden of securing gain (Yoga) and safety
(Kshema) for them upto Himself.Nityayuktah Those who constantly meditate on the Lord with intense devotion and onepointed mind.
(Cf.VIII.14XVIII.66)
