nectar.Commentary The Lord is called Janardana because all pray to Him for worldly success; prosperity and also salvation. Arjuna also prays to the Lord to explain His Yogic power and glory; for his salvation.Arjuna says to Lord Krishna Tell me in detail of Thy mysterious power (Yoga)
and sovereignty (Aisvarya) and the various things to be meditated upon.
Tell me again though You have described earlier in the seventh and the ninth chapters succinctly for there is no satiety in hearing Thy ambrosial speech or nectarlike conversation. However much of it I hear;
I am not satisfied surely it is nectar of immortality for me.
