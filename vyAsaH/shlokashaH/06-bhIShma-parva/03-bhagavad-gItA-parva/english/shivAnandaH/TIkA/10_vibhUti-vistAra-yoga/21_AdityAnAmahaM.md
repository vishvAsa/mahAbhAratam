Pusham; Savita; Tvashta and Vishnu are the twelve Adityas. The twelve months of the year are the Adityas.The Maruts are the gods controlling the winds. Some hold that there are seven of them while others say there are fortynine.The twelve Adityas; the luminaries like Agni; lightning;
etc.; the Maruts; the stars; etc.; are the Samanya Vibhutis (ordinary manifestations) of the Lord. Vishnu; the sun; Marichi; and the moon are His Visesha Vibhutis (special manifestations) and hence they have greater splendour in them.You can superimpose the Lord on the sun and the moon; and meditate on them as forms of the Lord. You can practise the same kind of meditation on all forms mentioned in the following verses of this chapter.
