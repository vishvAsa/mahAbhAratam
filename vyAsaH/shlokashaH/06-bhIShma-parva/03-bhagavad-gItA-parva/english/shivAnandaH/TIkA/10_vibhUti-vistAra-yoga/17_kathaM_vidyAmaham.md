10.17 कथम् how; विद्याम् shall know; अहम् I; योगिन् O Yogin; त्वाम्
Thee; सदा always; परिचिन्तयन् meditating; केषु केषु in what and what; च
and; भावेषु aspects; चिन्त्यः to be thought of; असि (Thou) art; भगवन् O blessed Lord; मया by me.Commentary Arjuna says O Lord; how may I know Thee by constant meditation In what aspects art Thou to be thought of by me Even when I think of external objects I can meditate on Thee in Thy particular manifestations in them if I have a detailed knowledge of Thy glories. Therefore deign to tell me; without reserve; of Thy own glories. Then only can I behold oneness everywhere.
