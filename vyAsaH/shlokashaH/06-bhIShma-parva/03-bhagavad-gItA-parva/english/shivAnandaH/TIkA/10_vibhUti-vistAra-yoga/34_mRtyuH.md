forgiveness.Commentary I am also the allsnatching death that destroys everything. Death is of two kinds; viz.; he who seizes wealth and he who seizes life. Of them he who seizes life is the allseizer and,hence he is called Sarvaharah. I am he.Or; there is another interpretation. I am the Supreme Lord Who is the allseizer; because I destroy everything at the time of the cosmic dissolution.I am the origin of all the beings to be born in the future. I am the prosperity and the means of achieving it of those who are fit to attain it.Beauty is Sri. Lustre is Sri. I am fame;
the best of the feminine alities. People who have attained slight fame think that they have achieved great success in life and that they have become very big or great men. I am speech which adorns the throne of justice. I am memory which recalls objects and pleasures of the past.The power of the mind which enables one to hold the teachings of the scriptures is Medha. Firmness or Dhriti is the power to keep the body and the senses steady even amidst various kinds of sufferings. The power to keep oneself unattached even while doing actions is Dhriti. It also means courage. Kshama also means endurance.Fame; prosperity; memory;
intelligence and firmness are the daughters of Daksha. They had been given in marriage to Dhrama and so they are all called Dharmapatnis.
