Samata is that state wherein there is neither Raga (like) nor Dvesha (dislike); when one gets pleasant or unpleasant objects. There is neither exhilaration when one gets pleasant or favourable objects nor depressions when one gets unpleasant or unfavourable objects. Tushtih is satisfaction or contentment. The man of contentment is satisfied with whatever object he gets through Prarabdha.
He is satisfied with his present acisitions. He is free from greed and so he has peace of mind. Contentment makes a man very rich. It annihilates greed. Greed makes even a rich man a beggar of beggars. A greedy man is ever restless. Tapas is restraint of the senses; with bodily mortification through the practice of fasting and slow reduction of food. The strength of the body and the senses is reduced through fasting.Danam is beneficence. It is sharing of ones own things with others according to ones own means; or distribution of rice; gold;
cloth; etc.; to a worthy person; in a fit place and time; especially to one who can do nothign in return.Yasas is fame due to Dharma or virtuous actions.Ayasah is illfame or disgrace due to Adharma or sinful actions.All these different kinds of alities of living beings arise from Me alone; the great Lord of the worlds; according to their respective Karmas.
