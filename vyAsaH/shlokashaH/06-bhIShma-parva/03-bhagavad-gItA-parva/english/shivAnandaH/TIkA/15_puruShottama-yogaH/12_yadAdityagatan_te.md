मामकम् Mine.Commentary The immanence of the Lord as the allilluminating light of consciousness is described in this verse.I am the cause and the source of the light by which the sun illumines the world; as also the reflected light of the sun in the moon and that of fire.Tejah Light The light of consciousness.If that is so; an objector says The light of consciousness exists alike in all moving and unmoving objects. Then why has the Lord mentioned this special alification of light as residing in the sun; moon and fire Please explain. We say The higher manifestation of the light of consciousness in the sun; etc.; is due to a large concentration of Sattva in them. Sattva is very brilliant and luminous in them. That is the reason why there is this special alification.Here is an illustration. The face of a man is not at all reflected on a wall;
piece of wood or a block of stone; but the same face is reflected beautifully in a very clean mirror. The degree of clearness of the reflection in the mirror is acording to the degree of transparency of the mirror. The more the transparency of the mirror; the better the reflection of the face the less the transparency; the worse the reflection. Even so Gods light shines in the sun and also in the pure heart of a devotee.
