पुरुषोत्तमम् the Supreme Purusha; सः he; सर्ववित् allknowing; भजति
worships; माम् Me; सर्वभावेन with his whole being (heart); भारत O Bharata.Commentary The glory of the knowledge of the Self is described in this verse.Asammudhah Undeluded; free from delusion. The undeluded does not identify himself with the physical body. He never looks upon the physical body; the lifeforce; senses; mind; intellect and the causal body as the Self or as belonging to himself; because he is resting in his own essential nature as ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute and because he identifies himself with Brahman or the Supreme Being.That aspirant who knows that Sri Krishna is not a human being and that He is the highest Purusha or the Supreme Being is undeluded. Such an aspirant or devotee alone worships Him with his whole being. He is the Sarvavit or Sarvajna; allknower. He knows and realises that Lord Krishna; the supreme Lord; is the Inner Self of all beings. He beholds the One in the many; and the many in the One. For him there is neither high nor low;
neither pleasure nor pain; neither virtue nor vice; neither good nor evil; neither likes nor dislikes.Me The Lord as specified above.Sarvavit One who knows everything in detail.Knows that I am He.Sarvabhavena With all his heart; with his whole being; wholeheartedly with his whole thought devoted exclusively to the Self of all with his whole mind centred on the Supreme Self alone.
