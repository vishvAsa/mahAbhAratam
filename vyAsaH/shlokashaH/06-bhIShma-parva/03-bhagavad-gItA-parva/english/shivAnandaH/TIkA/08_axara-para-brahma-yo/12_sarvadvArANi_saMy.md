8.12 सर्वद्वाराणि all gates; संयम्य having controlled; मनः mind; हृदि in the heart; निरुध्य having confined; ट and; मूर्ध्नि in the head; आधाय
having placed; आत्मनः of the self; प्राणम् breath; आस्थितः established
(in); योगधारणाम् practice of concentration.Commentary The gates are the senses of knowledge. Closing the gates means control of all senses by the practice of Pratyahara or withdrawal of the consciousness from them.
Even if the senses are controlled; the mind will be dwelling on the sensual objects. Therefore the mind is confined or fixed in the lotus of the heart and thery all the thoughts or mental modifications are also controlled. The whole lifreath is now taken up and fixed at the crown of the head (Brahmarandhra or the hole of Brahman).
