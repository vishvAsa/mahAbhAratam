8.27 न not; एते these; सृती two paths; पार्थ O Partha; जानन् knowing;
योगी the Yogi; मुह्यति is deluded; कश्चन anyone; तस्मात् therefore;
सर्वेषु in all; कालेषु times; योगयुक्तः steadfast in Yoga; भव (be) thou;
अर्जुन O Arjuna.Commentary Knowing the nature of the two paths and the conseences they lead to; a Yogi never loses his discrimination. The Yogi who knows that the path of the gods or the path of light leads to Moksha
(gradual liberation); and the path of darkness to Samsara or the world or region of birth and death; is no longer deluded. Knowledge of these two paths serves as a compass or a beaconlight to guide the Yogis steps at every moment. He strives to stick to the path of light.
