2. Is it the aggregate of the senses or individual consciousness

3. What is Karma Is it Yajna Or; is it distinct from Yajna  
  
4. Adhibhuta is knowledge of the Bhutas. Is this the knowledge of the elements or something else  
  
5. Adhidaiva is that which is associated with the gods. Is this the meditation on the gods Or; is it the consciousness associated with the Suryamandala; etc.  
  
6. Adhiyajna is that which is associated with Yajnas or Vedic rituals.
Is this the Para Brahman (Supreme Being) or any special god Is it of the same form (Tadatmyarupa) or is it entirely nondifferent (Abheda) Does it exist in the body or outside it If it exists in the body; is it the intellect (Buddhi) or distinct from it  
  
7. At the time of death; when the memory is lost and when the senses become cold (i.e.; when  
  
they lose their vitality) how can the man of onepointedness and of steadfast mind know the LordO Lord Madhusudana Thou art allmerciful.
Thou hast killed Madhu and removed the miseries of the people. Even so Thou canst remove my difficulties and doubts very easily. This is nothing for Thee; the omniscient Lord. (This is the reason why Arjuna addresses the Lord by the name Madhusudana.)
