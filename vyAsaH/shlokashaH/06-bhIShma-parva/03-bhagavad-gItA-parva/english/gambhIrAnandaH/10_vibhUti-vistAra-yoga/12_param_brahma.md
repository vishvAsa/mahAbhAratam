10.12-10.13 Arjuna said You are the supreme Brahman, the supreme Light,
the supreme Sanctifier. All the sages as also the divine sage Narada,
Asita, Devala and Vyasa \[Although Narada and the other sages are already mentioned by the words 'all the sages', still they are named separately because of their eminence. Asita is the father of Devala.\]
call You the eternal divine Person, the Primal God, the Birthless, the Omnipresent; and You Yourself verily tell me (so).
