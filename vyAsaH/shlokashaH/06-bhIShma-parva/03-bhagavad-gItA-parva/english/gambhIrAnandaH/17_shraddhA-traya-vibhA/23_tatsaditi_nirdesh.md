17.23 'Om-tat-sat' \['Om, That, Existence': 'Om iti brahma, Om is Brahman' (Tai. 1.8.1); 'Tattvamasi, Thou art That' (Ch. 6.8.7); and
'Sadeva somya idamagra asit, This was Existence alone in the beginning,
O amiable one' (Ch. 6.2.1)-in these texts Brahman is indicated by the words Om, tat, sat.\]-this is considered to be the threefold designation of Brahman. The Brahmanas and Vedas and the sacrifices were ordanined by that in the days of yore.
