2.45 O Arjuna, the Vedas \[Meaning only the portion dealing with rites and duties (karma-kanda).\] have the three alities as their object. You become free from worldliness, free from the pairs of duality,
ever-poised in the ality of sattva, without (desire for) acisition and protection, and self-collected.
