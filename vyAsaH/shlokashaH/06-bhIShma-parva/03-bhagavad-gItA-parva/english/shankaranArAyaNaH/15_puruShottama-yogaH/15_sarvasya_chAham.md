15.15. I am entered (the Self-conciousness is felt) in the heart of all;
from Me (this Self-consciousness) come the faculty of memory, the faculty of knowing, and also the faculty of differentiating; none but Me is to be known by means of all the Vedas and I am alone the author of the final part of the Vedas and also the author of the Vedas themselves.
