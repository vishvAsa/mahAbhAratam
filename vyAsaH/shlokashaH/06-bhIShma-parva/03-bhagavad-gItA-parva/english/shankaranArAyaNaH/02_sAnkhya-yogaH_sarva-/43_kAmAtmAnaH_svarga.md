2.42. - 2.43. O son of Prtha ! Those, whose very nature is desire, whose goal is heaven, who esteem only the Vedic declaration \[of fruits\], who declare that there is nothing else, who proclaim this flowery speech about the paths to the lordship of the objects of enjoyment-\[the paths\] that are full of different actionsand who desire action alone as a fruit of their birth-they are men without insight.
