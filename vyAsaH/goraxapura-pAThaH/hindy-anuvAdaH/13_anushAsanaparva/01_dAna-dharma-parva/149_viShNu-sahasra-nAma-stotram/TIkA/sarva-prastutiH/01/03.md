He of a lovely form. Though भगवान is taking a form which is unique with head and body not mutually matching and not comely, He is श्रीमान् i.e., His form is celestial and very charming with beauty, loveliness and other qualities. The combination of the forms of man and lion in him is so perfect and appropriate that those who have seen it would almost feel an aversion when they see a simple lion or a man without such combination. The world was indeed protected only by assuming such a unique form. "By the celestial Lord नरसिंह, who assumes a body with frightful jaws, the fear of the gods was dispelled and the world was saved."

The Supreme amongst the invidual souls. The sublime quality that distinguishees परमात्म from other souls is shown by this name lest some should think that there are others equal to Him. The word पुरुष which signifies a sentient being, distinguishes 'परमात्म from पाकृति or Primordial matter which is devoid of knowledge and which is in two forms - subtle and gross (i.e. invisible and visible). The part of the word 'uth', in 'uththama', which means 'superior' distinguishes परमात्म had it been used, from the Released Souls (or मुक्ताs). The superlative suffix 'thamap' in the word 'uththama' distinguishes परमात्म from the Eternally free souls like आदिशेष and Garuda. This distinction of परमात्मा from all (The forms of them) is because of his sublime superiority which is natural to Him and which is due to His being opposed to all blemishes, His help to all things by pervading and protecting them and by His being the Supreme Master of all. There is mention in the शास्त्राs that there are two kinds of पुरुषs (क्षार-souls in bondage; अक्षरa - Mukthas or Released souls). "Earth, water fire, wind (ether all of which are the forms of Prakruthi, are mine)" "Who realises me as having no birth from beginningless time" "He Who is changeless and pure" "The supreme, the greatest among the great" From these and many other passages it can be seen that परमात्म alone is Supreme. Here also it is clear that there is absolute difference between the enjoyer (जीवात्म ), the object of enjoyment (nonsentient matter) and the Director (परमात्म). Therefore the theory that Brahman itself becomes पुरुष and Prakruthi is refused. There are other theories that Brahman undergoes all changes and wallows in the material world (because of Avidya or Nescience, that there is a Brahman other than the ईश्वर (the Supreme ruler), the nonsentient Prakruthi, released Soul and ईश्वर all of them get dissolved in Brahman and emerge from it. If these views are accepted they go against the declaration here about पुरुषोत्त्म and against all the established doctrines of the वेद..

He who is all भगवान् is superior to all, and does not depend on anybody for anything. Still He does not neglect any one since, He sustains the forms, the existence and activities of all of them. He considers them as His body even as soul does its own body. So, He is Sarvah--- all. (The root 'sr' in) 'सारथी' has the suffix 'van' in the sense of moving the limbs. 'सारथी' which means 'moves' is to be taken here in the sense of knowing. Here is an etymological interpretation of this name, 'Sarvah'. "They call भगवान् ' सर्व' as He is the cause of creation and destruction of all things that are known as 'असत्' (i.e. अचेतन) and 'सत्' (i.e.चेतन), and as He has the knowledge of all things at all times." It has been declared that the basis for the use of समानाधि करण्य (i.e.co-ordination or grammatical apposition), of all things with परमात्म is this kind of pervasion or relationship. The Vedic Text begins by saying. "All things are connected with Him as gems in a thread" and declares "He is verily all this." "Thou pervadest all things. Therefore Thou art Sarva, (all)."

The result of the contact with भगवान् does not stop with the destruction of some particular sins as ordinary acts of expiation do, nor does it get exhausted by the granting of only a particular fruit (desired) like करीरि, Chithra, दर्सपूर्णमास and other sacrifies or like the worship of other minor deities, nor obstructed by powerful impediments, nor reduced in degree, nor is it destroyed. Not only does it completely destroy the inauspiciousness in a devotee, but also fulfils all his desires in many ways. Even then it does not stop with it (but is ready to grant more). The one (भगवान् ) who fulfils the desires of many (जीवाs)." "Whoever realises this Brahman that is indestructible, he gets whatever he desires." "When He is pleased, what is there which is unattainable by a devotee?" "विष्णु, indeed, grants all the fruits ( desired)". "O Sage! Just as a person who, though reaching a mountain of gems, gathers gems only according to his capacity (and not all), similarly one gets his desire from कृष्ण in accordance with the quality of saththva in him." "When भगवान् विष्णु is pleased by worship, one gets the fulfilment of all one's desires in this world, attains Svarga and a status where he is honoured by all the denizens of Svarga, and also gets Salvation which is (normally) very difficult to obtain." "मधुसूदन, when meditated upon, gives to his devotee unasked, that which is difficult to get, which is impossible to obtain and which is beyond the comprehension of the mind."
