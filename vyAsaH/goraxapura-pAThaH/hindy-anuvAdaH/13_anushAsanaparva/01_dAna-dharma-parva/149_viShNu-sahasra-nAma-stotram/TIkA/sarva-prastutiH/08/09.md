The invincible. It is impossible to bring Him under control by the ordinary power of the human or divine beings. "Who can seek and find Him out if He does not ढow Himself?" So, He is Durjayah.

He Who cannot be dispensed with. He is Dur-athikrama, because there is no other refuge excepting His own feet; (against them no one should act). So it is stated in the श्रुती "If men succeed in rolling up the vast sky as a small leather-bag, then a person will be able to attain the end of his sufferings even without knowing God," (Even as the former is impossible, the latter also is difficult to achieve&) "Who can attain Salvation without worshipping वासुदेव ?" "All the वेदा-s are always singing in chorus that there is no other means of redemption except (the worship of) विष्णु . There is no doubt about this."

He Who is difficult to be attained. If the mind of a man goes after other things, Lord जनार्दन is beyond attainment." "O King! केशव cannot be attained by men if their senses are not conquered by them." So He is Durlabha.

He whom it is immpossible to attain. Just as the mid-day such cannot be seen by men with weak eyes, भगवान् Who is endowed with much more brilliance and splendour cannot be realised by weak-minded people. This is much more true by the maxim of दण्ड-अपूपिक . [दण्ड-अपूपिक-न्याय -The maxim of the stick and the cakes. When a stick and cakes are kept together and one says that the stick has been pulled down or eaten by the rats, we are naturally led to expect that the cakes also should have been pulled down or eaten by the rats as a matter of course, the two being so closely connected together. So, when one thing is closely connected with another in a particular way, and we say something of the one, it naturally follows that what we assert of the one can, as a matter of course, be asserted of the other.]

The Dispeller of the evil minded enemies. The difficulty in the attainment of भगवान् mentioned above is only with reference to those who are great sinners and who are not eager to attain Him. This is being dealt with by the following twenty-four names (names 787 to 810). दुरारिण are those Who follow the evil path. He gets rid of them by several mans like making them give up the path of the वेदा-s. Vide in the वैष्णव ( पुराण ) - "By His powerful skill He confounded in several ways their minds and led them astray as a result of which there was not even one amongst them who had a liking for the वेदा-s. They became averse to go in the right path and they were easily disposed of by the gods."

He with a bewitching form. How did he get into their fold? It was by virtue of His charming figure-शुभाङ्गः . He had such a fascinating body by which He beguiled and deluded the असुरा-s. It made them think that he was an extremely trustworthy man.

He who preached essential things in the world. How did He deceive them? लोक सारङ्गः-He explained to them that there are only two essential things in the world, enjoyment of the wordly pleasures and the attainment of salvation. He taught them this with appropriate reasons. Indeed He advised them to do as follows: "If you wish to attain salvation, follow my words." "The affix 'khach' comes after the verb 'gam' (to go) when a word ending in a case-affix is in composition with it. (शरम्+gam=सारङ्गः .) "The affix 'khach' may optionally be considered as if it had indicatory 'u'. The force of 'u' is to cause the elision of the final vowel with what follows it. (So the word may be सारङ्गः or सारङ्गमः .)
