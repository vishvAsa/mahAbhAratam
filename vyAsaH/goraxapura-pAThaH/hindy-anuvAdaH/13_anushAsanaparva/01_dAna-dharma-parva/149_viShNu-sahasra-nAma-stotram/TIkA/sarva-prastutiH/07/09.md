He who is worshipped with supreme oblations. "There was no killing of any animal." "There were only recitations of the Hymns sung in the अरण्यक portion of the वेदा-s." (अरण्यक is a class of religious and philosophical writings (connected with the ब्राह्मणा-s) which are either composed in a forest or must be studied there.) In this way the offerings to Him involve no cruelty to animals. They are सात्विक and are based on the Upanishads. Vide- "The oblation of the Brahman which has the Brahman for its instrument (is offered into the fire of the Brahman by the ब्राह्मण (jivathma.) By him who meditates on the Brahman as (the soul of) work, Brahman alone is to be attained.)" "(And others) offering in addition the sacrifice of knowledge (worship Me as one-(Me), who, marked by diversity in various ways, am multiform)." "Being what I am, I worढip Him and do not go against Him whose property I am." "I make this sacrifice of myself to the Supreme in the effulgent Sun who is the cause of my attaining release (from samsara)." "I myself offer my own self in the fire." Or it may be taken that all these texts refer to the submission of the pure soul (आतमा ) as an offering in a sacrifice. "It was felt by Uparicharvasu, an exclusive and singleminded devotee that his soul, kingdom, wealth wife and vehicles were all for भगवान् ." This fact is revealed by this text also "The sacrifice of knowledge is superior, O slayer of foes, to the sacrifice of material objects."

He who is worthy of praise. The affix 'yath' is added to the root 'sthu' (to praise) in the sense of 'he deserves praise.' भगवान् alone deserves praise since, He is endowed with highly auspicious qualities which are eternal boundless and flawless. He alone is renowned as the Lord of the Thousand Names and His praise alone is not vain flattery. Other gods etc. are not fit to be praised as their qualities are quite contrary to the above. In the बार्हस्पत्य स्मृति it is stated: "A person praises a rich man with great fervour on account of a desire for money. Who will not be released from bondage if he praises the Creator of the Universe in that way?" "These are the thousand names of the reputed Lord Who deserves to be praised with them."

He who relishes praise. He is Sthava priya since, He is pleased with anything that is said with the idea of extolling His qualities. It may be done by any person in whatever way and whatever language. It may glorify Him or ever denigrate Him. The story of घण्टाकर्ण is a striking example for this quality of the Lord. (घण्टाकर्ण -He was one of the attendants of Siva and was such a great devotee that he did not like to hear the names of विष्णु and other gods, even spoken casually by others. Lest they should fall in his ears, he suspended two bells from his ears and whenever a person began to speak of विष्णु , he would shake his head violently so that the ringing of the bells would deafen him. In his eagerness to avoid hearing he was keenly observing if any one spoke that name and this, in fact, ended only in his thinking of that god always, though without devotion. It is said that this constant thinking of विष्णु earned for him salvation.

The Eulogy incarnate. The praise of him is accomplished by himself as an instrument when He is pleased with the singer. This praise of Him is accomplished by Himself as an instrument when He is pleased with the singer. This is seen in the praise of भगवान् by Dhruva. (The young child Dhruva was doing severe penance in order to realise the Lord. When the Lord appeared before him, the child was struck dumb with emotion and could not utter a word. The Lord with love touched the cheek of the child with His conch. The next moment words of praise began to flow from ध्रुवा 's mouth.) "The affix 'ष्ट्रन् ' comes with the sense of the instrument after the roots 'दाम् ', 'ni', 'yu', 'yuj', 'sthu', 'thuda', 'si', 'sicha', 'miha', 'patha', 'dasa' and nah'."
