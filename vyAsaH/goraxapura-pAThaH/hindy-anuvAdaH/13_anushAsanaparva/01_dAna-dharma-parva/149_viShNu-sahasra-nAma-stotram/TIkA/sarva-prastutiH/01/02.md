The supreme Soul Unlike all beings which have Him as their Inner Soul, परमात्मा does not have any one as His Inner Soul (आत्म ). Therefore भगवान् is called परमात्मा. The word 'Parama' is derived thus: 'parah मा asya' meaning ' He who has no one superior to Him; The form 'parama' is gramm- atically correct on the analogy of the word 'paramah' (Supreme) and 'आthma' (Inner soul). That is to say there is no ruler above Him who controls Him. The following passages establish this fact: "He who is the ruler of His own आthma." "There is no one who is superior to Him." "Nothing is seen which equal or superior to Him." "Superior to Him there is no one whatsoever." "The best of भारता-s! Nothing is seen which superior to the Lotus- eyed (Lord)." "Greater than the Lotus-eyed (Lord) there was nothing (in the past) not will there be (in the future)." "There is no God greater than केशव ." "Nothing is higher than the Parama-पुरुष , who is without end, beginning or middle." "Greater than Myself there is nothing else." "There is no greater nectar than भगवान् of Universal form." "He is greater than the great. He is superior and He is the Supreme Soul."

परमा गतिः- He, who is thus the Supreme goal for all the Released Souls ( मुक्ता-s). They are called the Released Souls who once for all and completely are free from the enshrouding coverings which are the results of the bondage of the Primordial Matter, nescience latent impressions of actions and their fruitions. Here are some passages from the scriptures:- "(The उपासक ) casts off his merits and sins (पुण्यः and पापः ). "Ever as a horse shakes its hair (to get rid of the dust), he casts off his sins." "shaking off the merits and sins". "Then the learned उपासक becomes freed from name and form." "When he realises God, he is released from all bonds." "The knot binding the heart is cut." "They cross this माय (i.e. संसार )". (गीत ). श्री नारायणीय (महाभारत ) teaches: -- "Those, who are bereft of the seventeen qualities and actions, give up the fifteen 'Kalas' (or lores) and become Released Souls. This is certain." Note- Seventeen qualities Five Elements, fiveज्ञानेन्द्रियs, five कर्मेन्द्रियs, mind and time. The sixteens parts (Kalas) are mentioned in the प्रस्नोपनिषद्. It has been established in the Scriptures that those, who have been freed from all the shackles of संसार attain equality with परमात्म, the Supreme Soul, in regard to the essential nature which is full of unlimited knowledge and Bliss, in re- gard to the eight qualities beginning with "being devoid of all sins" and end- ing with "unfailing will" and also in regard to the enjoyment of Beatitude. "Witnessing the desired objects through his celestial eye and mind, he is happy." "Becoming devoid of all sins, he attains utmost equality with the Lord." "They attain a state of equality with me (like Myself in regard to the poss- ession of auspicious qualities)." "बद्रायण affirms that there is no contradiction between the two statements that the Muktha's essential nature is knowledge only and that they are end- owed with many qualities. This is because of earlier statements according to which the pure soul is bereft of all blemiढes, and full of auspicious qualities." It is further established that the Released Souls attain a similarity with परमात्म even in regard to their bodies which are composed of unmixed and supreme सत्वगुण (Suddha-Saththva). "He becomes one, he becomes one (he becomes two fold)." "He eats, plays and enjoys." "He enjoys whatever he desires, assumes whatever form he wants and follows (The Lord)." "The fragrance of Brahman enters into him." "The taste of Brahman enters into him." "The celestial damsels adorn him with the decorations of the Brahman Itself. "बद्रायण holds the view that the Released Souls are in two forms (i.e. with a body or without a body as they like). It is like the सोम Sacrifice,' द्वादशाः ' by name, which is to be done for twelve days and which is of two kinds (either with one master or many masters) or (either for prosperity or for progeny.) Here the word 'मुक्तानां' used in the plural number shows clearly that the Released souls are many and are different from one another. So do the Scriptures declare. "All become free by the grace of theपरमपुरुष." "The worshippers of परमपुरुष become great and attain the Transcendent world of Bliss (परमपद )." "They attain a state of equality with me in regard to the possession of auspicious qualities like Myself." "They attain Me." As it is stated here itself that 'He is a witness." (साक्षी -names 15 and 517) and that He is the object of attainment by the मुक्ताs ( Released Souls), it is clear that there is difference between गवान् and Released Souls. So do the Scriptures declare. "When the उपासक sees the Lord as being pleased with him and also realises His Greatness, he becomes bereft of all sorrow." "When he understands that the आत्मा (individual Soul) (which is driven about) and He परमात्म, (who drives him) are different." "The Released Soul attains the परमपुरुष." "The Released Soul enjoys all bliss along with the omniscient Brahman." "He attains the Lord of Supreme Effulgence." "It is stated that परमात्म is attained by the Released Soul." It is also clearly stated in मोक्षधर्म (महाभरत): "He is Lord नारायण and He must be known as the Supremeपुरुष and the Inner Soul of all beings. Just as the lotus leaf is not tainted by water. He is not tainted by any dirt (i.e.blemish). He who is the other, is known as कर्मात्म and is the victim of bondage and release. He becomes associated with all the seventeen (qualities). Note The seventeen qualities are : Fiveकर्मयोगs five ज्ञानयोगs, five भूतs, mind and time. From all these, this theory is dispelled by theशास्त्र themselves, theory viz, that Brahman itself, circumscribed by a real or unreal उपाधी (i.e. a limiting adjunct) becomes a pray to the worldly miseries like the other circumscribed in a vessel, and that there is absolutely no difference in the state of Release between the Supreme Brahman itself", which speak of non-difference betw- een the two are reconciled with the other view that those two are different. This is in analogy with the statement. "This is a cow" in regard to those which have broken horns or without horns. All the cows under the genus of cows are called as such, though there is an external difference - some having broken horns and some not so. In the case of those who say that there is non- difference, statements which affirm non-difference and which affirm similarity between Brahman and Jंvas in the state of Release will co- ntradict each other. अनुपाधिक-भेद-वादिनs (i.e. those who hold the view that non-difference is the truth and difference is caused by limiting adjuncts) accept that there is an bond to the entity of the Muktha or Released Souls. In that case the state of Release will cease to be an object to be desired or longed for; again it will be against the statements that declare that existe- nce of difference in the state of Release. The supreme similarity (betwe- en the परमात्म, the Muktha) which we have delineated has been described as non-difference. So (अभेद्य ) the non-difference delineated in the Upani- shads refers only to the similarity of the qualities and not to the non-exis- tence of the entity of Muktha as such.) The विष्णपुराण explains this as follows: "तद भावा-भावं आपन्नाः तदा असु परमात्मना भवति अभेदे" thasya-pertaining to परमात्म ;भावनः-qualities like knowledge, strength etc. तेषां भावः - their manifestation i.e., similarity of qualities. In the interpre- tation given by others, the second word 'भाव' would be purposeless. "This Muktha (Released soul) attains a nature which is similar to that of परमात्म. Then he becomes non-different from परमात्म" The Prohibition of difference in the state of Release has been indicated to be with reference to the adventitious conditions as good and the like (by the sameविष्णु पुराण) as follows. "There is no longer the difference in the form of gods and the like; that shroud (i.e. Karma, which has been concealing the similarity between the जीव and theपरमात्म) has been dispelled. This word 'gathi' (in the name "मुक्तानाम परमाँ गतिः") has at its end the suffix 'kthin' in the sense of the passive. 'Gathih' means attainment. A word in the Accusative case (i.e. objective case) refers to an object which is most desired; and that is the goal of attainment. By this it is shown that the relationship between the Released Soul and परमात्म, the object of attainment, is that of servant and master. The Vedic मन्त्राs say: "Having attained the Supreme Soul (परमात्म) full of bliss." "(The Muktha) follows Him" "By that path by which परमात्म moves, by the same path the Muktha goes with Him. This is similar to a young cow going after its calf or a calf foll- owing its mother-cow." "Like the shadow of an object that goes with the object wherever it goes." In the same manner (does the Muktha follow theपरमात्म). It is from the Sc- riptures that we know about the existence of जीवात्म and परमात्म. The same scriptures reveal that the जीवात्म is 'Sesha' or subordinate toपरमात्म and that this subjection is natural to him like knowledge and other qual- ities of his and in the state of Release this attribute of subjection is not negatived. On the other hand, because of the removal of obstruction, it becomes manifest. "He becomes endowed with the form natural to him (which was conce- aled till now)" says (the chandogya Upanishad). विष्णु dharma also states: "Just as the radiance of a gem is not newly created, (but only made mani- fest) when the dirt on the gem is removed by polishing, so too knowledge and other such qualities are indeed quite natural to him (and are always there though latent at some times (i.e. in संसार). "Oh! The ruler of Men! Knowledge and non-attachment riches and virtue - all these four qualities are eternally present in the जीवात्म who is like Brah- man Itself because of his similarity." The Brahma सूत्र also confirms this; " When the Muktha attains the Brahman, there is the manifestation of his essential nature which is his own. This is revealed by the use of the word 'svena' (his own) as an adjective qualifying the noun रूपेन' (his essential nature or form)". Here an objection is raised: "He attains independence". "He becomes a sovereign". After quoting these texts, the independent sta- tus of a Muktha is establisheed by the following Brahma सूत्र; "For that very reason he has none as (his) lord." Against all this, how can it be said that he exists for the benefit of another and how can the undesirable state of a depe- ndent be predicated about him? Dunce! Don't become an object of ridicule. Here the import of the word 'Ananya-adhipathithvam' (i.e.being without another master ) is that He is under the control of भगवान् only, who is His own Master. The domination of other things like distress and karma over the Muktha has been removed. This does not mean that he is an 'अनाथ ' (i.e. one without a master to save him). If that were the case, the word 'अनाधइ पति ' (which means without a master ) would have been used, and not 'ananya-adhipathih' (which means 'without another master'). In the case of a wife, being subject to a greatly loving husband is not loathsome to her for we see that even kings and others are eagerly served and subserved by their sweet hearts and others when they do what is most pleasing to them. Again and again it has been indicated that it is the qualities that occupy a place of importance (and not any thing else). It has been establiढed in the Brahma सूत्रs that the equality between the परमात्म and the जीवात्म is only with reference to the enjoyment of Bliss and excludes the state of being the ruler on the one hand and the ruled on the other. "The जीवीत्म is like theपरमात्मa Himself except with reference to the activities regarding the Universe, Viz. Its creation, destruction etc." "There are clear indicatons to ढow that the equality of the जीवीत्म and परमात्म is only in the enjoyment of Supreme Bliss." Here are other texts in support of this view:- श्री विष्णु तत्वा- 1. "The Muktha attains complete subjection to परमपुरुष. He gets rid of all bondage and attains unparalleled freedom. He enjoys all Bliss along with the परमपुरुष." "With the जीवीत्म the state of being a property (that is possessed) rests and the state of being the owner or possessor rests with परमात्म. This is the relationढip between the two. Nothing else appeals to me." श्री नारायणीय (महाभारत)- "At the end of the observance of our vow, we saw men with highly auspicious qualities, white, bright like the moon and endowed with all lovely features. Their hands were joined in prayer at all times, and they were meditating upon the Brahman with their faces turned towa- rds north east." "With their hands joined in prayer they are always happy and are always repeating the word 'namah' (which means salutations unto Thee)". "They have controlled the sense-organs, and remain without food. They do not perpire and are always sweetsmelling." These and other such texts describe the residents of स्वेत-द्वीप (the Holy White Island ) and say that they are endowed with divine features and the like, and they derive great pleasure in being the servants of the Lord and in doing unceasing service to Him. The same is said to be the state and occupation of the Mukthas or Released Souls. This is reiterated by the following text: "The best among the भारताs! Those men who are released from here have the same characteristics as those who are the residents of स्वेत-द्वीप (The Holy White Island)." By the use of the word 'परमा' (highest) as an adjective qualifying 'gathih' (goal) (in the phrase 'परमा gathih) it should be understood that there are some for whom the goal is of a lower order. Such a goal, which goes by the name of Kaivalya, is resorted to by those souls who are free from old age, death etc. (श्री कृष्ण says in the गीत ). "They resort to me and make efforts to be devoid of old age and death." It is stated that such a place (Kaivalya by name) is some where between संसार (material world) and Paramapada (Transcendental word). "That is the eternal world of those yogins who are satisfied with enjoyment of the Bliss of their own individual soul." Such is the Supreme Goal of the मुक्ताs. "He is the Highest means; He is the Supreme Goal." "He who is the inner Soul of the universe and the highest goal". "(They attain) Me, the unsurpassed Goal." "He reaches the end of the road (i.e.परमात्मा)." "There is nothing greater than the attainment of the (Supreme) आत्मन् ". Texts like these can be easily got. That भगवान् is the Supreme Goal of attainment, for, the Mukthas is corro- borated by the next five names (13 to 17).

He by whom Mukta is not sent away. The word is derived from the verb 'na वीयते .' His name is Avyaya, because no one is sent away by Him. The suffix added is 'erach'. The names प्रत्या' (94), 'विनयः' (510)'जयः' (511) and the like belong to this group (which has this particular suffix). Is it not a well-known fact that the भगवान् never sends back that आत्म who has, by some means and with great effort, crossed the vast ocean of संसार and has reached His lotus-feet. That is why the Vedas declare- "They who go by this path (i.e. अर्चिरादि-गतीi) attain भगवान् and) do not come back to this mortal world." "He does not return; he does not return" "There is no return according to the scripture. There is no return according to Scripture." Yama स्मृति i Says: - "The Muktha bears a body of pure and subtle Saththva and attains the Supreme Lord who is the परमात्मा and नारायण as well as the glorious and superior वैकुण्ठा . Then he becomes fit for immortality and does not come back (to this world) any more." dealing with yathi-dharma (the code of the सन्यासि ) says:- "One who has taken to the life of a yathi (Recluse) is calm equally disp- osed towards all beings and self-controlled. He attains the highest place (i.e.वैकुण्ठा ) and after reaching it, never comes back".

The generous Giver He bestows gifts in plenty. 'Puru' means plenty, and 'sanothi' the verb signifies the act of giving. The suffix 'da' is added when the root 'san' is preceded by the particle 'puru'. The rule says that it is added even in the case of other particles. भगवान् indeed bestows even on the Mukthas the enjoyment of the Bliss of Himself, His qualities and His glory all of which are beyond the range of words and mind. Here are the Vedic मन्त्राs that reveal this:- "He (भगवान् ) alone confers Bliss" "He (The Muktha) enjoys all desirable things along with the omniscient Brahman." "By his celestial eye and mind he (the Muktha) sees all desirable things and enjoys." "There the Muktha enjoys all kinds of bliss. He eats, plays and experie- nces joy." "He enjoys all that he desires and assumes whatever form he likes." "He (The Para Brahman) is itself Bliss. Having attained that Para Brahman this Muktha becomes endowed with joy, when he attains the Brahman." "भगवान् (who is आनन्दमय is said to be the source of Bliss for others. (i.e. the individual souls)."

He who sees them all directly. Bhagaवाn is known as "साक्षी" (witness) because He directly sees the मुक्ताs enjoy the Bliss He has bestowed and he is also happy seeing them full of joy. The suffix 'in' is added to the root according to a grammatical rule to form a noun to show that the person is direct eye-witness to a particular act. The object of attainment by the Muktha, viz,. "Brahman, the Omniscient". Omniscience is explained as knowledge capable of cognising all things of varied nature.

The knower of the field for action. Bhagavan is called क्षेत्रज्ञः because he knows the extreamely suitable place for conferring on the Released Souls in this way the joy of enjoying Him. The suffix 'ka' is added to the root 'ज्ञ' (to know) in the word क्षेthrajnah according to the grammatical rule which says. "The suffix 'ka' is added to a root which ends in 'आ' (likeज्ञ), when it is not preceded by a preposition and the final 'आ' of the root is dropped." The parama-vyओma, i.e. vaikuntta is referred to here as क्षेत्र (field) because it is the place which yields the crop of Bliss in plenty. or 'क्षेत्र' may mean the body of bhagaवाn itself possessed of a similar quality. The Vedic Manthra proclaims "Brahman has आकाश (i.e. vaikuntta) as its body. " In Narayaण्य (महाभारत) the goal of attainment by the muktha, i.e. परमात्म, is specified as the क्षेत्रज्ञ in the following Slओka." "Oh Brahma! The goal of attainment for the mukthas is specified as the क्षेत्रज्ञ ." That again is the place where the मुक्ताs enjoy भगवान् . "He (the muktha) enjoys (भगवान् ) in Parama-व्योम , i.e., vaikuntta." "The greatness (in the form of enjoying भगवान् ) is obtained by the muktha in श्री vaikuntta." "He (the muktha) shines in श्री Vaikuntta" "He (the muktha) enjoys Bliss in Vaikuntta" Here is a Manthra which expresses the wish of a muktha who does not want rebirth in this world. "When compared with the eternal Viakuntta (Parama-आकाश ) this आकाश (Ether) adorned with flower - like stars is without lustre like night. I go to vaikuntta and begin to live there. May I not have rebirth." "That is the supreme Abode of Mine, after reaching which they (the Rel- eased Souls) do not come back." In the मोक्षधर्म , it is said:- when the soul gets rid of the fear of old age and death, he becomes endowed with the auspicious qualities mentioned in the authoritative texts viz. Vedas and आगमा, and he becomes freed from the cause (i.e.Karma) and its fruit (i.e. the body). The आकाश he reaches (i.e. vaikuntta is without the name and form of the ordinary world and he rem- ains there without a body (like the one in the material world). In the विष्णु पुराण- "Those yogins who are exclusively devoted to Brahman and who are engaged in its meditation, reach a supreme place which the सुरी-s (Eternal Angels) are always seeing (i.e. enjoying)." In the Brahma पुराण much is said about श्री vaikuntta. It begins with these words: That is called 'Parama-Vyओma' (i.e.Supreme आकाश or श्री वैकुण्ठ ) about which it is said that there is nothing in it (like those that are seen in this world)." Then it continues "The undisputed conclusion is that it is the place known as मोक्ष " (Salvation) and that it is the place of Supreme Effulgence which belongs to विष्णु In the वराह पुराण भगवान् says to sage Agasthya, " See this world which exists for My sake and which is not seen even by the Vedas. O best of Brahmins! This world has been shown to you in order to please you." Agasthya says in the वराह पुराण - "O Lord the world that pertains to you is the best and the noblest of all worlds. O Sage, I have seen all the worlds of Brahma, Indra and others. Oh best of as- cetics! It appears to me that this is a unique world. It is replete with wealth and riches and radiance as well as gem-set storeys of palaces. O Sage engaged in the practice of severe austerities!. I am even now steeped in the meditation on that supreme world. When am I going to reach that best and noblest of all worlds? This is the thought that is ever haunting me", and so on. In Rigvidhi it is stated- "They say that this Supreme Abode is the primary cause of all effects, the highest objective of all words and the ultimate object of realisation of the योगा-s." Sage Dhaumya speaks in the आरण्य पर्वं very highly about that place and says "The Supreme Lord, नारायण, is the Deity without beginning or end, and He is said to be the eternal cause of the Primordial matter from which all beings emerge. His supreme world is far more effulgent than the world of Brahma." "O Bharatha (Yudhishttira!) The souls after reaching it do not return to this world. O King! This place is firm, imperishable and indestructible. "युधिष्ठिर ! Bow before this world which pertains to the Lord always. In the Harivamsa in the episode in which the sons of a pious Brahmin are carried away and are brought back by भगवान् , who Himself says: - "The best of Bharathas! (Arjuna) ; You have seen that celestical world of wonder, full of Brahmic effulgence. I am He (whom you saw there) and that is the effulgence of Mine which is eternal. That is my supreme Prakruthi (or Transcendent Nature) which is both Vyaktha and Avyaktha (manifest to the devotee) and unmanifest ( to the impious). O Best भारताs (Arjuna)! The Souls (जीवाs) enter this Prakruthi and they become mukthas (Released Souls), O पार्था! (Arjuna); It is the goal for the साङ्ख्याs (i.e. those who meditate upon the जीवा for its realisation) and for the योगिने-s addicted to penance. The entire Universe which wishes to attain it resorts with devotion to that supreme Bra- hman." The reputed Brahma Samhitha narrates the serial order of the तत्वाs and says. "Paramaपुरुष resides in the heart-lotus and He is multifaced. He is omniscient, all pervading, and is Himself all things, He stands enveloping all things. The pure and subtle आकाश (श्री वैकुण्ठ ) shines with His effulgence. That Transce- ndent world (paramapada) is like pure crystal and replete with joy. Those who have realised the तत्वा-s (rishis) attain this world and are freed from the touch of things both auspicious and inauspicious (i.e. पुणय and पाप). They are of the size of a त्रसरेणु (i.e. a particle of dust composed of three atoms) and are adorned by millions of rays. Neither do they take birth in this world, nor do they die." All this is well-known from passages like these- In this Paramapada, there is a city which goes by the name of 'अयोद्ध्य' and 'अपराजिता'. There is a Palatial mansion 'अपराजितम्' (Invincible) by name. There is a Hall of celestial beauty supported by thousand pillars etc. In it is a couch on which the Lord along with लक्षमी is to be meditated upon as the object of enjoyment for the numberless Released Souls. All this is well-known from the छन्दयोग , तैत्तिरीय, Kaushithaki and other Upanishads.

He who never wanes. He is calles अक्षरः because He never becomes less; nut as the object of enjoyment He ever grows more and more like a stream of honey in spite of His being enjoyed by the मुक्ताs at all times there. Such is the manifestation of His unlimited qualities. The suffix 'ach' is added to the verb 'क्षरति' according to the grammatical rule that the suffix 'ach' should be added after 'pachathi' and other verbs. The names 'विकर्मः' (79) and 'Suranandah' (188) are words ending with the suffix 'ach'. "परमपुरुष is unsullied even though He is attained and enjoyed (by other i.e. मुक्ताs). Since, He does not owe His greatness to others and since He is great by Himself, His supreme nature never diminishes." In the शारीरक (i.e. Brahma सुत्रा-s) in the fourth chapter मोक्ष has been affi- rmed to be of this kind. This chapter cannot be interpreted as delineating fruits of a lower order. In that case the earlier three chapters which deal with the means of attaining Salvation, the Upanishadic texts which have been quoted as authority, and Smruthi, Ithihasa and other Scriptures also will have to be taken as dealing with those fruits of a lower order, and all of them will become शास्त्र that have nothing to do with the मोक्ष. Thus, भगवान् is the Supreme Goal of attainment for the मुक्ता-s.

He who is the Means It is stated that, this भगवान् alone is the natural and independent means for salvation. The word योग is derived fromt he verb 'Yujyathe' which means 'With whose help the goal is attained.' The suffix 'ghajn' is added to form a noun by the rule-'ghajn' is added which signifies any case exc- epting the nominative-case." The names 'मार्गः' (367,399) (161) and others have been derived by the addition of the suffix 'ghajn'. The meaning of the word 'योग' is that He is the immediate cause of Salvation and does not stand in need of the help of anything else. "This (भगवान् ) alone confers joy". "It is declared in the वेदा-s that He is the cause (for the bliss of जीva)." "I shall set you free from all sins."

नेता He who leads those who practice yoga भगवान् leads to salvation even those who adopt the means that are not direct. 'Thrich' is the suffix that has been added to 'नयति' from whichverb the name नेता is derived. भारता (33) धाता (43,951) and other names also have been formed with the suffix 'thrich' at the end. भनवान् carries on the task undertaken till the fruit is attained. "In order to bless them (I dispel their ignorance)" "I lift them up (from the ocean of संसार which is frightful like death)" "Hari alone ought to be propitiated by those who wish to cross the va st ocean of संसार" "Having attained the Eternal भगवान् , they all become freed (from संसार)."

The lord of Primordial Matter and Purushah. भगवान् is the Master in every way of the Primordial Matter and जीवाs (आत्मा ) - प्रधान, which is the cause of bondage, and जीवाs, who are the souls bound by it. The suffix 'varach' is added to the roots 'स्था' (is) 'भाs' (shiine) 'ईश ' (to rule); and thereby the name "ईश्वर " is formed. The name स्थावर (428) also comes under this class. "(भगवान्) the ruler maintains this universe in which the changing Prakruthi and the unchanging जीवa are united and which again is composed of matter, subtle and gross. The जीव who is not a master himself is kept under bondage and experiences (the fruit of his action. When he realises the Lord, he is freed from all bonds). "भगवान् the master of Primordial Matter and आत्म as well as the Lord of all qualities." "That One Deity controls the क्षार (Primordial Matter) and the जीवात्म." In this way the Supreme Master (भगवान् ) has the power to indulge in sport binding with His Maya the erring जीवा-s and setting free (from bondage) those who seek refuge in Him. "The Master of all beings." "This Prakruthi, composed of the three गुणा-s (Saththva, Rajas and Thamas), is mine. I am entertaining Myself, playing with it." "An instrument for play for the sporting Lord." "A toy (the universe is for भगवान्.)" "भगवान् is at once the cause for the bondage, release and sustenance of this world." श्री विष्णु Thaththva declares: "Excepting the Grace of भगवान् there is nothing any where that can bring about the destruction of the माय (i.e. the world) which He Himself has created. This truth we say in brief." Here are two Aphorisms from the Brahma सूत्रा-s to that effect. "It is only by the will of परमपुरुष that the natural form of the जीवा is concealed. Again by His will alone the bondage and its oppposite (i.e. release) of the जीवा are brought about." "This concealment (of the true nature of जीवा ) is caused by the contact with the body (at the time of creation) or by the contact with the Primordial Matter (i.e. prakruthi) (at the time of deluge)." The suffix 'varach' is used to ढow that the quality spoken about is innate and inseparably associated with that person. By its use here, it is shown that the difference among the three Realities (Sentient, Non-Sentient and God) and the state of भगवान् being the ruler and the other two being the ruled are nat- ural and not conditioned by any adventitious cause.
