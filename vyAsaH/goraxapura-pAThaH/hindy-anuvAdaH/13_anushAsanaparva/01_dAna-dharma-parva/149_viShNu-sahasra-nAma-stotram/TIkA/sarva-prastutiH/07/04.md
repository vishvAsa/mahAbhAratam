He who is worshipped. व्यास next proceeds to state that all that has been stated above with reference to superior qualities of भगवान् is quite possible and stands to reason. He is Archithah. Archa is the incarnation of भगवान् in images and Architha signifies He has that form. This incarnation of भगवान् in images or icons is not in a far off place like the पर-रूप , (the Transcendental form of भगवान् ). Nor is it limited to a particular place or time like His incanations as a god (उपेन्द्र for example) or a human being (as राम ), all of which are known as विभवा-अवतार . But it is perceptible in holy places, temples and houses at all times. The mysterious truth about it can be learnt from the Bhagavath शास्त्रा-s (also known as पञ्चरात्र आगमा-s), बोधायन Smruthi, वैष्णव पुराण and other scriptural Texts. Vide : in वैष्णव धर्म "After having shapped a beautiful image of विष्णु with a lovely face and lovely eyes out of gold silver and the like in a manner that would be pleasing, one should worship it, do sacrifice to it and mediatate on it. By doing so one would enter into that form which is none other than Brahman itself and will have all one's sins dispelled."
