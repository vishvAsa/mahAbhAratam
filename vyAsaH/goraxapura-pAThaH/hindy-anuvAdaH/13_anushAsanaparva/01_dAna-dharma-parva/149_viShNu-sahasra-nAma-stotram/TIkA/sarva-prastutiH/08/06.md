<details><summary>पराशरभट्टः (En)</summary>

He Who swerves. He is called चलः , because for the sake of helping the पाण्डवा-s who were His devotees, He even swerved from the righteous path of keeping His word. श्री कृष्ण had taken a vow that He would not handle or use any weapon in the भारत-युद्ध् . But in order to save Arjuna from भीष्म He did not mind breaking His vow with the Chakra in the uplifted hand He ruढed towards भीष्म to attack him. Vide- "श्री कृष्ण , the younger brother of महेन्द्र (in one incarnation) seized the Chakra and with a loud war-cry rushed forward against Bhण्ढma). Seeing the angry कृष्ण all the beings (in the battlefield of कुरुक्षेत्र) cried aloud in distress thinking that the destruction of the कौरवा-s was certain. वासुदेव the Lord of the Universe, jumped down from the chariot with the Chakra in hand and rushed forward as though he was going to annihilate all the army. He shone like the धूमकेतु (the comet) which rises to burn all the beings of the Universe.
