Vide : "कृष्ण is described by all wise men as the Supreme Lord of all lords in the world. But what they have said is only a small part of His greatness. How can it be called as praise or hyperbole when one states what actually exists in Him?". "O हृषीकेश ! (The Lord of all इन्द्रिय-s, श्री कृष्ण !) It is quite appropriate that the world is delighted by Thy fame, and becomes drawn towards Thee".
