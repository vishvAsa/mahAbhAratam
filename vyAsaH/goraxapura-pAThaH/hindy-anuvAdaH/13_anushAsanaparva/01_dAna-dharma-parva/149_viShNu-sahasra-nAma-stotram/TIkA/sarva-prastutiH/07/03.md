"Where the ancient साध्य देवा reside." शेष आदिशेष ; शेषासन विश्वक्सेन , the Lord's Commander-in-chief, 'who takes in only that which remains after having been offered to the Lord first. These are all known as नित्य सूरी . Thus far the supreme nature of भगवान् to its highest extent has been portrayed.

ईदृश-सौशील्य-सत्वेन अस्य अतिमहती कीर्तिः इति सत्कीर्तिः । एतावद्धि सुवचनम्, यदस्य कीर्त्यते तदस्ति तावदिति, न तु यावदस्ति तावदिति तदधिकं वेति । यता- "यथा सर्वेश्वरः कृष्णः प्रोच्यते सर्वपण्डितैः । तथाऽपि स्वल्पमेवोक्तं भूतार्थे कतमा स्तुतिः ॥ " (विं.ध.75.44) "स्थाने हृषीकेश! तव प्रकीर्त्या " इत्यादि च ॥ (गीता 11.36)

ईदृक्सौशील्यसत्वाद्धि सत्कीर्तिः इति कथ्यते ॥]
</details>

<details><summary>पराशरभट्टः - श्रीनिवास-राघवः (En)</summary>

He of true renown. He is Sath कीर्ति , because He has a great and pure reputation for being so amiable and affable by nature. It would be quite correct to make a statement as follows with reference to His nature. 'Whatever is said of भगवान् in His praise does exist in Him. But it does not mean that all that exists in Him is only that much and not more; or more has been said than what actually exists in Him.' Vide : "कृष्ण is described by all wise men as the Supreme Lord of all lords in the world. But what they have said is only a small part of His greatness. How can it be called as praise or hyperbole when one states what actually exists in Him?". "O हृषीकेश ! (The Lord of all इन्द्रिय-s, श्री कृष्ण !) It is quite appropriate that the world is delighted by Thy fame, and becomes drawn towards Thee".

The Dispeller of all doubts; As He has the great reputation of being endowed with qualities like amiability and affability, all doubts about Him stand dispelleddoubts, if He can be easily known or is difficult to be known, if He can be easily pleased or is difficult to be pleased, and if He is easily accessible or difficult to approach.
