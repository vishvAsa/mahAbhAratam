(1) My salutation to Govinda (Embar) and my father (Srivatsanka). I contemplate on Lakshmanarya (Sri Ramanuja) and meditate on Mahan (Peria Nambi). My mind be full of Yamunarya (Alavandar). I approach respectfully Ramamisra. May I see face to face Pundari- kaksha Acharya. I adore Natha-muni, the first of our Acharyas. My adorations and praises go to Satari (i.e., Nammazhvar). May I have a vision of Lakshmi. Helpless as I am I surrender myself unto Sridhara (i.e., the Lord of Lakshmi). 

(Thus, the Guru-parampara, the line of spiritual precepters, is extolled.)(Embar and Kurattazhvan are referred to by the dual, Govinda-Tatau, because both are the direct preceptors of Sri Parasara Bhatta and the disciples of Sri Ramanuja)

(2) Salutation to Vishvaksena, the commander-in-chief of Lord Sri Ranga, and who rules with his followers, such as Gajanana, and who is ever with Sutravati (his wife). 

(In the usual Guruparampara, Vishvaksena comes between Namm- azhwar and Lakshmi. Here, Vishvaksena gets a whole stanza to himself; his name was omitted in the previous stanza.)

(4) Inspired by Rangesa and given the title of Parasara Bhatta by the lord of Sriranga Himself, I, the person named Ranganatha, the son of the sage, Srivatsanka, who (the said Srivatsanka) ever considered his discipleship under Ramanuja as a great treasure - I now proceed to comment on the (holy) Names of lord Hari, with a view to obtain the blessings of Lord Ranganatha and His Consort, Sri Laksmi.

(5) In samsara (the world of recurring births and deaths) generally, there is already great ignorance about the Lord; more so in the Kaliyuga (the age of darkness and sin). And it is out of foolhardiness that I venture to speak to men who deem them- -selves perfect, of the secret of the Vedanta. May Vyasa who composed this hymn of praise, and the Merciful Lord Hari who is the object of praise there in - may they both bear with me for this folly.

We see in the world that any intelligent person, after having gained some knowledge of the objects of human pur- suit through the sources of knowledge (such as perception; in- ference etc. ). desires to enjoy the good things of life like flow- ers, sandal, gold, etc., to eschew things like knife, thorns, etc., which are unpleasant, and is indifferent to neutral things like a piece of wood or mud. Of these, the two purusharthas (objects desired by men) known as artha and kama (wealth and pleasure) are experienced by means of actual direct perception and inference. They are to be given up, because they are associated with innumerable imperfections like the following;- they are (1) petty, (2) lead to harmful conse- quences. (3) are disgusting, ( 4) are evanescent,(5) are mixed with distressful things, and (6) are not even easily obtainable. On the other hand, (the other two primary objects of human pur- suit), dharma (virtue) and paratattva (salvation) can be learnt only from the scriptures. These are opposed to the other two purusharthas (i.e. artha and kama) and are full of beneficent qualities. Therefore, the sastras (scriptures and works of reli- gious authority) and their teachings are to be preferred. As is proclaimed with one voice by those learned in the Itihasas (epic history) and the Puranas: "Truth, this is the Truth and again the Truth. This is procla- imed with hands uplifted that there is no sastra (authority) higher than the Vedas, no God higher than Kesava." As regards the V edas, the highest of the fourteen subjects of' study (vidyasthanas), they are to be understood in their fullest extent and scope through the ltihasas and Puranas. It is also said that "Veda trembles with fear at the sight of ignorant or half-learned persons, thinking, 'They will betray me' (by mis- interpretation):' Hence, it is clear that the understanding or interpretation of the Vedas can be done only through the study of the Itihasas and Puranas ; and of these two since the Puranas are mentio- ned subsequent to ltihasas, the Itihasas are more important. [This reasoning is arrived at according to rules of grammar . In a copulative (dvandva) compound, the word with less number of vowels must be mentioned first, except in that case where the thing denoted by the word with the larger number of vowels is preferred for some reason .] Hence, the Mahabharata, like the Ramayana, is the proper refuge for us (to understand the Vedas.)

(1) ESSENCE OF THE MAHABHARATA - The Mahabharata is considered by great men as a great authority, and more so, because it is an Itihasa with clearly worded and well-constr- ucted sentences and phrases. Both in the Vayu Purana and the Saiva Purana, it is said of this great Itihasa: "The venerable Vyasa churned the ocean of the Vedas, using his intellect as the churning rod and produced for the good of the world, this moon called the Mahabharata". Bhavishyat Purana :- "Man is afraid of the sastras like a diseased man of a bitter drug. Hence it is that the essence of all the sastras has been used to bring forth this Mahabharata as a delightful poem". Matsya Purana :- "God Vishnu himself was born as the son of Parasara called Krishna Dvaipayana, by whom, for the sake of lighting the world, the moon named the Mahabharata was produced". Vishnu Purana :- Know then that Vyasa, called Dvaipayana, is no other than Lord Narayana Himself. Who else could have produced this great work, the Mahabh- arata ?" So also does the Markan- deya Purana say: "This world has been sanctified and has been made free of impurities by the floods of the (holy) words of Vyasa, descending from the high mountain of the Vedas, and cutting at the very roots the trees of false and perverted dharmas". In the Mahabharata itself it is stated that a Brah- min who is not versed in this Itihasa, but only in the four Vedas, Vedangas and Upanishads, is not learned". Thus, the Mahabharata is extolled by thousands of sayings. -

This work follows and is consistent with the Vedas, the books of sacred law, Itihasas and Puranas with all their sub- sidiary parts or auxiliaries. Indeed, it is said: * 'What is found here is to be found elsewhere; whate- ver is not found here cannot be found elsewhere". Thus, whatever is performed or is to be performed for salvation, according to the Vedas etc., " and whatever is to be performed by way of worldly conduct are dealt with here and laid down in no uncertain terms and with- out bias or partiality. For all these reasons, many wise men have concluded that the Mahabharata is more precious than any other Purana.

This chapter of the Thousand Names occurs in the Anusa sanika Parvan, which is the heart of the Itihasa, and in the context of expounding the duty of charity, for the purpose of laying down the essence of the sastras in a short and abbrevi- ated form. As this work teaches us the highest goal, and as the doubts about its authoritativeness and its being intended as a mere matter of praise are dispelled (literally thrown far out) by the excellence of the reasons to prove that it is authoritative' and by the possession of the characteristics that this work deals with the Ultimate Reality, this work is eminently fit to be taken up by persons desirous of worldly prosperity or Action.

"Collated together by the Vedacharya". The exposition of the above is as follows:- The venerable teacher of the Vedas, Krishna Dvaipayana, is the most reliable (of teachers). For, He is an incarna- tion of the Supreme Lord Narayana, endowed with unsurpassed knowledge and other auspicious qualities, such as aisvarya, and not subject to any imperfec tions like confusion of mind or tendency to mislead others, or indifference. And he, being inspired solely with the desire to benefit the men of Kaliyuga, who are generally of dull minds, divided and arranged the Vedas. He composed the Maha bharata, called the fifth Veda, with the object of dispelling the ignorance, doubts or pervers e misconceptions of the people about the Real Truth and teaching the principles of good conduct enshrined in the Vedas. Look at the nobility of his ancestry. He is the great- grandson of Vasishta who, by a word of his, ennobled Visvamitra, a Kshatriya, into a Brahmin; is the son of Parasara who is extolled by the Linga Purana as a great soul, who had attained, by the grace of Vasishta and Pulastya, the true vision of the Reality and who attained eminence as the author of a purana (the Vishnu Purana). He is respected by assemblage of the rishis as one who has performed penances and yoga of unsurpassed austerity. Thus by him th e Names of Vishnu, which were sung by various sages, had been strung together in the form of a hymn of praise. Hence, this Chapter of Thousand Names has to be accepted as most beneficial (to mankind).

(4) Besides, Bhishma (who taught this) is recognised as a most trustworthy person. Veda Vyasa exhorted Dharmaraja to go to Bhishma for instruction in these words :-" O mighty King! If you want to be instructed In all dharmas, go to old Bhishma, the grandsire of the Kauravas. He is all wise; and knows the essential Truth of Things - the noble son of Ganga will resolve all doubts troubling your mind in respect of all subtle and mystic matters. He has seen face to face all the gods including their chief, Indra." Again, "In all assemblies where Bhishma was present, there were always to be found present holy rishis. There is nothing that has to be known which is not known to him. He, the great knower of dharmas and all subtle, mystic, spiritual truths, will instruct you in a11 dharmas",

Not only this. Even the Supreme Lord, Sri Krishna Himself (exhorted Dharmaraja to resort to Bhishma and) said: "Bhishma is on the bed of arrows like a fire slowly cooling. He is contemplating on Me. My mind goes to him. He knows all divine weapons. He has in his mind all the four Vedas and the Vedangas. I am now one with him by My will. O King of Bharatas ! he knows the past, the present and the future. My mind is with him. If this head of the family of Kurus passes away, there will be the danger of knowledge declining and perishing. Hence it is that I urge you to go to him. Further (He, the Lord, Sri Krishna, said to Bhishma) himself ; "O best of Bharatas, what you are going to say to Dharmaraja will be ever established in this world as permanently as the words of the Veda. The past, the present and the future are clear to you, old in wisdom, as (the fruit) in the palm of the hand. I have known you. You have indeed the capacity to create by your penance the world of movables and Immovables. .... No decay for you nor ignorance nor delusion... . Your mind will always be clear and calm like the moon cleared of clouds. ever rest in sattvaguna, and not be affected by rajas or tamas." [Sattva, rajas and tamas are the three 'qualities' or constituents of matter. They ar e believed to affect the mind also, sattva making it clear, rajas inducing passion, and tamas bringing about dullness, perversity and sloth.] .

The venerable Narada also (said) : "He knows fully well all the dharmas of the four varnas (castes). Hence tell him all your doubts (and get them cleared)". Narada also praised Bhishma as one of great eminence who had attained the vision of God on account of his association with and service to great rishis and elders, and also by his life-long and uninterrupted observance of celibacy, penance and contemplation. He also blessed Bhishma and directed him to expound to the listeners not only the Ultimate Truth but also the dharmas and rules of conduct. Moreover, Bhishma has already received the bless- ings of his father and mother by his services to them. Bhishma himself said these words about his knowledge of the Supreme Truth: "O Govinda ! By The grace and The blessings, the heat of the body, doubts, weariness, languor, exhaustion, disease, have all vanished from me. I see like a fruit in the palm of my hand, the past, the present and the future. O Achyuta, ! By Thy gracious gift are present in my mind all the dharmas mentioned in the Vedas and laid down in the Vedantas. By Thy grace again, O Janardana, and by constant contemplation on Thee, I feel strong like a young man and I can expound the dharmas". Such a Bhishma introduced the subject of the Thousand Names in these words. "I consider this dharma as the highest of the dharmas," and expressed his view that the chanting of the Thousand Names was his greatest mata or creed of faith.

(5) Accepted by all - The Thousand Names have been accepted by all in the world. In the Sabha Parvan, the Lord is praised a s adorned with Thousand Names: "The Lord is one with a Thousand Names, Supreme and birthless. In the Vishnu Dharm a in the context of the grant of salvation to Gajendra, the chief among elephants, Vishnu is praised as one with a Thousand Names, etc. Again, in this chapter, in the introduction and at the end where the fruits (phala) of the recitation are set out, the excellence of the Thousand Names is mentioned. So also, in AyurVeda (the Science of Longevity or Medicine) and in other sastras which deal with worldly benefits and spiritual welfare. The Charaka Samhita says. "By praising (with these Thousand Names) Vishnu of Thousand heads, the Lord of movables and immovables, a man is rid of all fevers". Even a modern work i.e., a collection of miscellaneous matters, in the context of dealing with the remedy for urinary troubles (meha), starts with "Let the Purushasukta be recited" and goes on to say that the Sahasranama of Bharata should also be recited. In respect of consumption cases also, the Thousand Names are to be recited as expiation. In cases of certain fevers, it is said that, after homa, the Thousand Names are to be recited. For getting rid of the bad influences of planets, the Thousand Names and the Marutsuktam are prescribed. So also in other places.

Even ordinary poets and writers describe this hymn as a protective force. In the Kadambari, Bhatta Bana, when he describes a room used for confinement of women at child- birth, mentions it as a place where the recitation of Narayana's Thousand Names is incessantly going on. Also in this world, it is seen that the Thousand Names are accepted with faith, because many persons learn, memorise, hear, recite, sing, write, comment on and show respect to those versed in the Thousand Names for the purpose of getting rid of inauspicious and grievous troubles caused by poison, ghosts, diseases, planetary influence, bad dreams and omens. (The Thousand Names are also used) for expiating grievous sins, gaining prosperity both here and hereafter, loosening the knot of the bondage of samsara and attaining Paramapada , the supreme abode of Vishnu. Some use them for the mere delight derived through the recitation of the names, from tasting the nectar of His beneficent and auspicious qualities. So too this hymn acts as the only effective medicine for children, mutes, foolhardy persons, women and atheists. Even the Vedas are not accepted as readily by all persons as this hymn, for fools and such others will not accept the Vedas. Besides, this hymn is open to all; but not the Vedas, as they are divided into many divisions, each to be resorted to by particular families, clans or sects. Hence it can be said that the Thousand Names have the excellence of being accepted by all.

This hymn is in conformity with and establishes conclusive teachings of the Mahabharata as established in its various portions such as the Bhagavadgita, Narayaniya, Yanasandhi, Agrapuja, Uttamadharmanusasana, etc. For these six reasons, this has been determined as the most fit and useful for all who generally act after full deliberation and after full satisfaction. All the various teachers of knowledge and of the sastras, (such as the deva-rishis and brahma-rishis like Devasravas, Devasthana, Narada, Vatsya Asman, Sumantu etc, who have striven for and obtained the vision of God have approved with delight this divine hymn. Also by Sri Krishna the Lotus-eyed, the Lord of All, the great Teachers of Gita, the Guru of our fore fathers, this hymn has been listened to with rapture, sitting along with others around Bhishma. In respect of such a great work, we now attempt a commentary for elucidating the true knowledge of the beneficent qualities of the Lord.

Sri Vaisampayana said : (1) Having heard all the dharmas in their entirety (without anything being left out) and all other purificatory acts, Yudhishthira addressed again Santanu's son (Bhishma) as follows: Here 'dharmas' means all those acts which are many and of the form of Raja-dharma (the duties of kings) , Moksha-dharma (the way to salvation) and Dana- dharma (the duty of charity), which are prescribed by injunct- ions contained in Sruti, Smriti, etc., as leading to worldly and heavenly' benefits as well as to eternal salvation. In entirety - completely to the extent to which it extends. Purificatory acts:- such as penance, pilgrimage to holy places. All - everything connected with them - i.e., the benefits to be derived by performing them, their divisions and their charact- eristics and those who have the qualification to perform them. Yudhishthira - himself the son of the god of dharma. The son of Santanu - Bhishma is the son of Santanu by Ganga and is thus of illustrious birth. Addressed again - The question is put to learn what exactly is considered by Bhishma as the most beneficial. 

In fact, that is known from the nature of the question put later on, "What is the dharma which is considered by you to be the best of all dharmas?. " 

His interest was sincere to follow the course of conduct of great men. 

For good men seek to know the stand taken by the preceptors and take delight in what is considered by them as the truth and as beneficial conduct. They do not do any action merely because it is laid down in Sastras. (Sanction by an authoritative sastra is not enough; it must be accepted and followed by great and good men).

We have already mentioned :- "An intelligent person should first examine the pramana (authoritative source of knowledge) and should take up such objects of knowledge as are for his benefit." They are of two kinds - upaya, the means, and upeya, the object or fruit derived. Of such fruits, there are three kinds: (1) what is desirable, (2) more desirable and (3) most desirable. Similarly, in respect of means also, there are three kinds - the good, the better and the best. In respect of the fruits (of actions), the following are the demerits - birth, growth, change and end, etc., and (if the fruit is sentient) they are further subject to the characteristics of sentient beings like pain, ignorance, attachment, dislike, karma (sins), the fruits of karma, and impressed tendencies on account of previous practice. Their merits are :- freedom from imperfections, being pleasing (to mind and body), permanence, infiniteness and (when the upeya is chetana) true knowledge, bliss, lordship and wealth, etc. In respect of the means, it is subject to imperfections, such as heavy expenses, bodily exertion, uncertainty of obtaining the fruit (vyabhicharitva), pettiness of the resulting fruit, etc. Its merits are: certainty in achieving fruit, freedom from decay, ease to perform, greatness of the benefit derived etc. A person must examine the upaya and upeya with their relative merits and demerits as stated above. What is excellent and best must be selected, and the other must be dropped, just as he had already abandoned some of the worst things at the original examination of the sastras. Hence, it is necessary to desire to know the best of upaya and upeya, distinguishing them from what is bad or low in comparison. Yudhishthira asked Bhishma only these two (the best of upayas and the best of upeyas), dividing the subject into six questions in two stanzas, led by the desire to investigate the subject.

Since the means (upaya) is required only for the purpose of gaining the end (upeya) and the end is therefore more important, the question in the first instance is about the upeya. Such upeya is dealt with by the sastras in two ways: one as the supreme tattva (Truth) and the other as the supreme goal to be reached. The question therefore covers both the aspects. First, Yudhishthira asks about the Supreme Reality.

Yudhishthira said: (2) Who is the One (Supreme) Deity according to the sastras ? What is the one Supreme Goal? (3) By reciting which mantra is a man released from bonds of birth and samsara? According to the 'sastras' :- This phrase is to be taken along with each one of the questions. "Considered by you as the best" :- This phrase (in the third stanza) is to be taken to link up with the previous stanza also, according to the simha-avalokana-nyaya - the maxim of the lion turning back to have a look. That is, this must be taken to qualify each one of the questions, of course, making the necessary changes in the case-inflections (of the nouns). Loke :- The word in the original, loka, means the thing by which we see, i.e., the body of sastras, consisting of sruti, smriti, etc. (Because only the sastras can teach us about the gods). The One (Ekam):- That which has none superior to or equal to itself. This is inferable from the later passages, "Of Him who is the greatest in the world" and "He who is the great, supreme splendour", which answer the question. This word is used here not to denote an individual or its number, because this is always inferable from the form of the word daivatam, which consists of the nominal stem (pratipadika) and the suffix indicating the singular. Then, the word One would become superfluous. Besides, if there is any deity not indicated as one and not possessing an individuality, the word One may perhaps be used. Since there is no such deity who is without individuality or is manifold, the word One must have its distinctive meaning as stated above. Moreover, it cannot be the attribute of any (deity), since in the answer to the question, there is nothing referring to One as number. Deity (daivatam):- That which possesses qualities like brightness, etc., peculiar to the Rulership of the Universe. The question, therefore, is: "Which is that Deity, which you conider as the Deity spoken of as the best in the sastras which reveal the ultimate truths?" Doubts arise on account of difference even in the minds of persons who believe that one Supreme God (i.e., one possessing all the qualities required for the Rulership of the Uni- verse) is taught in the various sastras and philosophies. These doubts are as to whether such qualities of Supreme lordship as, unlimited Knowledge and powers arise with reference to a particular modification of the unreal, evolving under the limiting adjunct of Maya, Vivarta, Parinama, Visesha etc. or whether rulership over all is natural (to any deity). Specifically also the question arises as to whether Hari (Vishnu) or Hara (Siva) or Hiranyagarbha (Brahma) is the Supreme Deity, because in the sastras such qualities (of Rulership, etc.) are ascribed to them indiscriminately both individually and in common. Hence the question is in the form: "Which is the Supreme Deity?"

</details>


<details><summary>English</summary>

The second question is: "Which is the supreme goal of attainment?" This question is propounded because there are conflicting opinions in sastras dealing with the ultimate benefit as to what is moksha (salvation) and what happens at that stage, such as whether (i) the atman perishes in moksha, or (ii) Nescience covering the atman is dispelled, or (iii) the qualities of the atman perish, leaving the atman alone to exist (Vaiseshika), or (iv) equality with the Paramatman is.attained, or (v) there is acquisition of the quality of the Paramatman, or (vi) the status of being a shadow of the Paramatman is attained, or (vii) the acquisition is only of the essential nature of bliss, etc., or (viii) a status of continuous service to the Lord is attained. In the original text, the words used in connection with the goal are "Kim va api ekam parayanam". Here va is a syllable denoting alternatives, and api conveys a conjunctive sense. Therefore, it is to be understood from this that the questioner wants to know whether the Deity to be determined as the Supreme One is different from the goal to be reached or whether such Deity is itself the goal to be attained. Or again, it may be said that the questioner wants to know whether the benefit (Moksha) to be enjoyed is the same for all or different in each particular case. Goal (Param Ayanam): all-beneficent and free from imperfection, hence, the Highest. Therefore, the question is: "What is considered by you as the highest goal desired by a person out of the very many desires relating to this world or the next?" Thus is the twofold question about upeya, the goal.

Then about the upaya. The question about the upaya (means) arises because there are disputes as to whether karma yoga, jnana yoga and bhakti yoga are alternative means or are to be adopted together or whether one or other among them is to be treated as the principal and the rest as subsidiaries. Again, the means are divided into three kinds; siddha, sadhya and salambana. The siddha upaya is one that is already existing, such as God, who, being worshipped, grants favours. This Deity may be worshipped in two ways - laghu (easy) or alaghu (difficult). Therefore the question is put in the said two ways by this half stanza: Praising whom or worshipping whom, will men attain the good? The question is about the deity worshipped, i. e., 'praised and worshipped'. Praising: reciting in praise the several auspicious qualities of the Deity. Worshipping:- carrying out supreme worship by means of bhakti (devotion) in the form of meditation . Men:- those possessing the only qualification of being a human being (irrespective of caste, creed, etc.) The good: -- This is of two kinds, relating to prosperity in this world or bliss in the next. (All this relates to the siddhopaya).

Next, as to Salambana Upaya, the means depending on aids such as the things or articles used for worship like Mantras to be repeated, flowers, incense (as also auspicious ob- jects of meditation like the idol or the figure of God). Of these, the question relates to the oral basis of japam (the mantra to be recited) by the words, Kim japan. By reciting which Mantra is a man released from bonds of birth and Samsara? Japa is repetitive recitation of a mantra, accompanied by prescribed rites, etc. Manu (11.87) says: "A Brahmin can attain anything only by japa. There is no doubt about it. Whether he does anything else or not it does not matter. For a person doing japa is friendly to all (but a person performing a sacrifice has to do cruel acts, such, as killing a goat, horse, etc.). Hence, he is the real Brahmin." Again, he says (11.85): "Japa-Yagna is ten times more effective than dravya Yajna, (sacrifice conducted with the help of articles.). In the Gita (X. 25) also, Sri Krishna says: "Of all Yajnas I am the japa-yajna." Thus among the actions of three kinds done by the mind, speech and body, japa is superior and the question here is only about the japa which is to be done by word of mouth - not about others which are to be performed either by the mind or by the body. Man (jantu) : anyone who has the characteristic of being born. ( Man is born only for the worship of the Lord) . Bonds of birth and samsara:- By birth is denoted, old age, death, the womb and tortures in hell, etc. which, result from the life in this world. Samsara denotes ignorance, the latent impressions from the sins or merits of one's actions, inclinations, desires and the contact with prakriti (matter): all these form the reasons or causes for the bondage (in the form of birth). Bonds (bandhana):- These are obstructions to the attainment of salvation. Released (Muchyate): Here the reference is only to moksha, the ultimate release: but from the trend of answers given, that the japa is the sadhana for all kinds of benefits. It must be taken that the question relates to all kinds of phalas (benefits). From the use of the words, loke (scripture), aseshena (in entirety), sarvasah (in full), and manavah (persons) it is clear that Yudhishthira has heard all things relating to dharmas, such as the seasons for performance, the qualification of the performer, the divisions and subsidiaries of actions and the benefits which are superior. So also he wants .all such information in respect of the dharma considered best by Bhishma.

These six questions are answered by Bhishma not in their order, but sometimes in inverse order and sometimes in direct order. Considering that Upaya (the means) is the more Important, as it is the basis for the upeya (the goal), and as the question relating to the upaya is the last, Bhishma starts his reply dealing with the means and the objects relating to japa. Bhishma said :- (4) A person who is ever and always engaged in praising with the (hymn of) Thousand Names the Lord of this universe, the God of gods and the Highest Person, with no limitation (with reference to time, place, etc.) - The Lord of the universe: - the Lord of the movables and immovables in the world. The God of gods.: - Just as the gods occupy a higher position than ordinary human beings who serve them, so also the Lord is higher than the gods in His glory, because the gods do Him service. Limitless :- whose glory is not curtailed or limited in any way. The Highest Person :- Whose gracious generosity is supreme. With the hymn of Thousand Names: - making it the oral basis of japa (recitative praise). Praising denotes that the praising is the cause (for freedom from grief). Who reaps this fruit ? Purusha - a knowing man. Ever engaged :- Continuous praises of and the thoughts of the Lord are very pleasing and beneficial to the devotee ; any break in such continuity causes him great pain.

Thus in the Taittiriya Upanishad (1.7): '"When for security (from fear of samsara) a devotee stands firm in the Lord, who is unseeable, bodiless, indescribable and needing no support, he obtains that security. But one who breaks away from the Lord (in his meditation) suffers from fears of samsara." This is explained in the Smriti also thus: The fact that Vasudeva is absent in the mind (contemplation) of a person even for a Muhurta or a second is a big loss, gives wide room (for bad things), results in perverse thoughts and wicked actions." Also: "Sitting in a cage made of the flames of fire is preferable to the torment suffered by associating with persons who have turned away from the thoughts of the Lord." Again "Even if one moment is lost without thoughts of the Lord one should weep, as though he has been robbed (of wealth) by thieves."

Thus has been described the object of japa, recitative praise. The fifth stranza furnishes the answer to the question as who is to be praised or worshipped. It will be noticed that the inverse sequence (the fifth query) the subject of dharma has to be treated here. But it is not so; the subject treated is about the person to be praised and the mode of worship (contained in the third and fourth questions). This is because the subject of worship and praise forms part of the supreme dharma and has to be expounded. (5) And (engaged) in worshipping always with bhakti the said Person, the Eternal, meditating upon Him, glorifying Him, saluting Him by prostrating before Him and adoring Him - Him only - The fifth stanza conveys the idea that the person who is the subject of japa is also the subject of worship. In the Mahabharata (Sabha Parvan) it is said at the time of according first honours to Sri Krishna : "We desire to offer our worship to Him who is full (of perfections) the great teacher, the first guru, eminently fit to be worshipped. Be pleased to agree, all of you here". "There is no person other than He fit to be worshipped". "Wise man do not offer worship to Brahma (the four faced Creator), Rudra and others mentioned as deities in the Smriti because the benefit derived from worshipping them is limited'. (Bharata-XII, 342.6); "The benefits derived from them are limited" (Gita, VII.23). Person (Purusha) :- the lotus-eyed (Narayana). Eternal ( Avyaya) denotes that, however much His qualities are enjoyed, more and more new qualities appropriate to Him spring up without end. Worshipping (Archayan) : performing bhakti yoga which is of the form of service to Him, Always (Nityam) denotes a person who cannot exist even for a moment without thoughts of Him like the devotees described in the Gita (X. 9) "whose minds are concentrated on Me and whose lives are dependent on Me". How to worship ? with bhakti, i.e., with the affectionate consciousness that "He is my Master and I am His servant." Again how? By meditating (dhyayan) : i.e., contemplating always on the virtuous quality of the Lord with a full mind so as to have a stream of thought like an unbroken stream of nectar and to put an end to the three fold suffering of samsara (pertaining to the Atma, pertaining to the gods and pertaining to the elements). How else again - Praising (Stuvan) : striving to recite by word of mouth the various qualities of the Lord, the body being thrilled with the bliss of enjoyments, the eyes streaming with tears of joy and the voice choked 'on account of such tears'. How again? Prostrating (Namasyan) :- Bowing low, i.e., offering at the lotus feet of the Lord, himself, who is impure because of egotism, and with his body and organs and senses, inner and outer, bent low on account of bhakti and the feeling of "Not mine", and uttering at the same time the prayer "All that is mine is Thine, Please take them." How else again ? Sacrificing (Yajamana) :- One who does worship to God, i.e., one who performs with sincere devotion an incomparable, pure and pleasing worship by offering (Him) a series of objects of enjoyment of various kinds suitable to His enjoyment, such as arghya (a respectful oblation of water) flowers, madhuparka etc. (a mixture of milk, honey, sugar, curds and ghee) respectively called aupacharika (ceremonial), samsparsika (tactile) and abhyavaharika (edible) all gathered with pure bhakti, and enthusism and a feeling of restlessness that he (the devotee) is unable to show full gratitude for the great act of grace shown by the Lord by making the devotee His own.

It is this bhakti yoga which is thought of in the Vedas and which is said to be the royal road to salvation. Because, the venerable Badarayana, after examining the Vedanta texts like "Knowing Him (Brahman) thus" ; "The Brahman knower attains the Highest,' ; "With the help of sacrifices, charity, penance and fasting (the devotee desires to see God)" and also "A person restraining the inner and outer senses sees the thus: - "Bhakti requires as ingredients all things like sacrifice, etc., as in the case of a horse (which can be used only with a saddle etc)" ; "(Not only karma) but the devotee must also cultivate restraint of inner and outer senses" ; and 'He must repeat often and often the practice of contemplation". Thus, he shows that bhakti is the best means for attaining moksha. For this bhakti is worship and meditation induced and fostered indirectly by the varnasrama duties and directly by peace of mind and restraint of senses, which are synonymous with ideas expressed in the words, vedana (knowing) dhyana (meditation), dhruva-smriti (unceasing remembrance, with special qualities pertaining to Bhagavan mentioned in the Sat, Ananda, Purusha, Upakosala and other Vidyas. For its climax, it has the direct clear vision (of God), which is attained by the strong impressions on the mind made by pleasant and often repeated thoughts, flowing in a constant stream, uninterrupted by any distractions by outer objects or things. The Vakyakara also says that vedana (knowing) is nothing but contemplation, for it is said: "It is this upasana which, when duly perfected, is bhakti. Why? Because it has the names of (1) samyoga, (association with fruit) (2) rupa, (form) and (3) chodana (injunction). (1) Samyoga :- This denotes that bhakti, like upasana, leads to moksha. It is said: "His form does not appear within the range of physical vision, no one has seen Him with the physical eyes. He is perceived by the mind through bhakti and steadfastness. Those who know Him thus become immortal." (Kath. Up II.6.9) Here "hrit" means bhakti. This is clear by the use in other sruti texts and in Smritis. In fact the Mahabharata, beginning with the words, "His form does not appear within the range of physical vision", goes on to say: ' One who has his soul filled with devotion (bhakti) and steadfastness (dhriti) gets a vision of the Intelligent Self (i.e. the Brahman). It is to be noted here that the word bhakti is used in the place of hrit. In the Gita also bhakti is said to be the means to attain mokhsa : "That Supreme Person, O Partha, can be attained by bhakti undistracted" (III. 22); and "It is possible (to see Me) only by undistracted Bhakti) (XI. 54), The Angirasa Smriti says: "By uninterrupted bhakli salvation is obtained" Again. In the Vishnu Dharma also :- "Unadulterated bhaki towards the Supreme Soul, Govinda, leads men to mukti, Do not feel any doubt about it". From the Ramayana: "Those who are immensely devoted to Thee, the Ancient One and the Highest Being, obtain all their desires in this and the other world. The devotees never fail in attaining their objectives." Again, the Vamana Purana declares: "Those, who are devoted to Vishnu and those whom Vishnu loves, intensely, perceive Him as the only goal and are not subject to further births". (Thus samyoga has been explained).

Indeed in the dictionary (nighantu), service, bhakti and upasti are treated as synonyms.

Hence, the wise use the word bhakti to mean great service:'Therefore, the idea underlying the use of the word upasana to mean bhakti is analysed thus :- It is of the form of limitless and devotion towards the worshipped God on account of His faultless qualities. And it contains in itself the sense of belonging to Him. It is this intense devotion that is referred to by the Lord in the Gita: : "I am the closest and most beloved to thejnanin". (VII 17) ; With love towards those who are devoted (to Me) .(X, I) ; and "'They feel glad when they talk about Me and feel happy when they hear about Me" (X. 9). In the Vishnu Purana, again, occur the two passages : "However many thousands my births be may I be devoted to Thee" (1-20-18) ; and also 'My love to Thee is as great as the love for earthly enjoyment is to fools" (1-20-1 ). It is also said: ..Being Immersed in the bliss of remembering Him". There is the further passage: " Thrilled by the remembrance of His Name was the Daitya Chief (Prahlada). In the Vishnu Tattva, it is said: Service done with true knowledge (that Bhagavan is the Master, and the Atma is His servant) is bhakti. When such service is being performed, love and affection do naturaily spring up," Says the Barhaspatya Smriti: "Whosoever is devoted to God and turns away from attachment to other things and has also renounced all desire (such as love of children, wealth and the world), he is fit to eat by begging (i.e. fit to become a sannyasin)". The Taittitiya sruti contains the invocation.: Let this God make us united with auspicious meditation'. Thus are all the sayings about the injunction to do upasana. (4) The word Anusmarana (repeated recollection) used in several places denotes that thought becoms bhakti, The prefix anu shows not merely continuity, but also humility, that is, the knowledge that the devotee is the servant of the Lord. Hence, thought along with the consciousness of this relationship is bhakti. In the Gita occur the words: Remembering (anusmarana) Me continuously" (VII 13) and .'Thinking of (anuchintayan)" (VIII.8). Elsewhere it is stated: .'Repeated recollection of Krishna (anusmaranam) is supreme", Recita- tion of His Holy Names (Kirtana) and prostration are included in bhakti. For example, the Gita says: "The devotees perform worship by recitation and prostration" (IX. 14) : as also "Keep Me in your mind (While doing all actions)" (IX, 34). This bhakti is called the Great Secret because it constitutes the essence of the purport of all the sastras, The Gita refers to it thus: "To you, this most hidden secret, I am going to reveal", (IX, I); "Having known it, there is nothing else to know'. (VII.2); and again, "This most hidden of all secrets" (XVIII. 64) More than enough has been said. On this subject, This will do.

(6) & (7) (And engaged in) praising Him, the Beginning- less and the Endless, the all pervading, the Ruler of all the worlds, the Supervisor of all the worlds (Universal Witness), the One to be known from the Vedas, the knower of all dharmas; the One who engages Himself in enhancing the fame of the worlds Master of the worlds, the Great Person and the Cause of existenc of all beings - such a person (worshipper) tides over all the sorrows in the world. The words "tam eva cha" at the end of the fifth stanza is to be taken along with the next stanza. (Now the further commentary is about the 6th and 7th stanzas). SHOWING AN EASY WAY FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT WELL-EQUIPPED. Then an observation is made as to the difficult nature of bhakti. This bhakti is grounded firm only on long continuous practice, and that too only after getting rid of all obstructions. This stage is gained only by those whose sins are cleared off by merits gained by performance of good and virtuous acts and conduct through births. It is said (in the Gita and Vishnu Dharma respectively) : " At the end of many births. one becomes a Jnanin (Wise man) and attains Me." (VII, 19), and in the course of thousands of different births" (69). Then what about persons who are unable to perform all the means enjoined by the sastras? In order to dispel such fears, Bhishma points out an easy way in stanzas 6 and 7 by answering the third question, "Praising whom."

To reach that Vishnu, who is the object of bhakti and who is alone fit to be praised and worshipped in every way, Bhishma enumerates His qualities by ten attributes, which begin with "the beginningless and endless" and which distinguish Him from all other minor gods. The beginnlngless and the endless :- The lord is ever ready to help; He is not limited by time. Vishnu: - Not limited by space; all pervasive. Great Ruler of all the worlds: He is possessed of mighty powers adequate to fulfil all the wishes of His devotees. Supervisor of the worlds; This quality is natural to Him. He never forgets, but remembers (to fulfil the wishes of His devotees). To be known from the Vedas (Brahmanyam) : All the Vedas In their branches extol Him, and so it is easy to know Him and praise Him. Knower of all dharmas: Just as He appreciates bhakti (taught by the sastras), He appreciates equally stava (praise). Enhancing the fame of the world: "By praising Him the praiser becomes himself praise- worthy," says the Vishnu Dharma. Hence in respect of all persons in all the worlds, who praise Him, He makes them also objects of praise by others. Master of the worlds:- Hence, He deserves all praise and service. In His essential nature He is endowed with supreme - greatness indicative of sovereignty. Great person (Mahatbhutam) : Possessed of supreme wealth which is natural to him. So He is worshipped easily. The great are easily pleased with those who show by some act of theirs that they are desirous of obtaining favours from them. They do not want anything more. In the Udyoga parvan (of the Mahabharata), it is said: "The Lord does not expect anything other than a jar of water (offered by way of respect), or washing the feet or kind enquiries about welfare". The case of all beings and their existence :- He is the cause of existence and life to those who are not atheists. Hence, He surely shows His grace to them. Praising (Stuvan): Praise in some way or other of His qualities will do; it need not be the same as or as perfect as bhakti-yoga. Tides over all sorrows: The devotee reaches the cool lake of unsurpassed bliss which is the Lord, after crossing the forest- fire of the threefold torments of samsara, In this context, it is proper that the word stuvan in stanza 6 should be interpreted to denote a very easy way of pleasing Him, The word stuvan, used earlier in the previous stanza, as it is combined with dhyayan, denotes a more difficult means of attaining Him (because dhyana etc., are not easy of performance). If not so understood, there will result the fault of repetition. Besides, among the questions propounded there is a separate question "stuvantah kam" (Praising whom). Hence this answer, contained in stanzas 6 and 7, must be taken to answer that distinct question separately. Again there is the fact that other sastras also support this view.

The Supreme Dharma ; Now, Bhishma proceeds to answer the 5th question. (8) This worship of the Lotus-eyed at all times by praises by a person with devotion is hence regarded by me as the greatest of all dharmas. This - what has been explained earlier as the difficult path and the easy according to the qualification of those resorting to them, i.e., worship (archana) and hymnal praises (stava). Of all dharmas, etc: Dharmas are divided into four classes (I) Dharma performed for material benefits, such as increase of wealth (literally of cattle) and for the begetting of children. (ii) Dharma performed for obtaining celestial pleasures, such as Svarga (the world of the gods) (iii) Dharma for the attainment of moksha, which starts with the performance, by persons with no attachment and with the sole consciousness of worshipping Him, of sacrifices, the building of temples. etc., and which finds its completion in knowledge of the Truth. (iv) Services done for His benefit only such as thinking of Him with love and affection, praising Him and bowing before Him. The fourth is the best of all as indicated by the superlative suffix 'tama'. With Devotion: Worship with love is the best. Anything done with love is done easily and with no effort. It has been sung in the Gita: "(lt) is very easy to do" (IX-2). For, to remember a loving husband is always a pleasant thing to do. This is different from the acts of worship of other gods who are not our true Lord, - a worship which is undertaken reluctantly like the drinking of a bitter medicinal decoction, with a view to obtain Some benefit. The Lotus-eyed : This describes the fascinating beauty of the object of worship - as distinguished from other objects which are worshipped by some and which are ugly and terrible to look at. By Praises :- Praising is easy, because only speech is necessary unlik.e sacrifices such as the visvajit or penances like the chandrayana which involve expenditure and much personal exertion.

So the venerable Vyasa says: "Those distressed, afflicted or enfeebled and those under fear or suffering from terrible diseases - all these, by mere uttering of the word 'Narayana'' are relieved of grief and become happy." In the Vishnu Purana, it is said: ''If one utters the Name even unconsciously ..." So also in the Vishnu Dharma: "Consciously or unconsciously if a man utters the (holy) Name of Vasudeva, all that (i.e., every sin commited wittingly or unwittingly) becomes dissolved like salt in water". Again, in the same work: "Water is sufficient to put out fire; sunrise dispels darkness; (so also) recitation of the Name of Hari extinguishes a multitude of sins of kaliyuga." So also the passages (in the same work): "By recitation of His Name, a person is saved"; "By recitation of His Name, a person is released from great fear" ; "One who utters once the two syllables of the name of 'Hari' has (thereby) packed his luggage to go to moksha" : "A person who remember His Name, attains after his death the highest world of Vishnu, hence there is no return to this world" ; "This utterance of the names, 'Achyuta'. 'Ananta' and 'Govinda', acts as an effective medicine to cure all diseases, This is true, this is true, I say". Elsewhere also: "Utter the name of Jagannatha or recite the Vedas. (They are equally efficacious)," In the Vishnu Sukta: "Those, who understand the holy Names as being the most distinguished and utter them, become fixed (in Vaikunta), without return to this world". Worship: This indicates that this dharma is of the form of serving a particular Supreme Being and that it is not very much beyond direct experience. In the Gita (IX. 2), it is said: penance and pilgrimage are pleasing to God is known only from faith in sastras (land is not directly seen); but, in the case of the stotra (or praise) we see from direct experience that it ought to be pleasing.

Person: This kind of worship by praise is open to almost all sentient beings in accordance with their equipment. The use of the singular number is significant, as praising (can be done) by any person by himself without seeking the help of others, and therefore it is unlike the great sacrifices which require the assistance of a number of persons. Even a person of bad character or conduct or of lowly birth may, without fear, approach God, solely by reason of the great virtue of a taste for devotion. Very soon, thereafter, he becomes purified of all taste for sin as if by a bath in the Ganges, and becomes an extremely virtuous man. So it is said in the Gita. Speaking of character, the Lord said: "I am equally well disposed to all beings" (IX. 29). About conduct, the Lord said : "Even if he is a man of very bad conduct"(IX. 30). And about birth, He said: "Even persons born from sinful wombs, they will resort to Me, O Partha" (IX. 32). What does the above mean? Does it mean that even bad conduct is recognised as dharma? No; bad conduct is condemned everywhere. For instance: "A person who does not keep away from bad conduct, or one with senses uncontrolled or one with no peace of mind cannot (attain the Atman by knowledge)" (Kath. Up. I.II..23). Again, "O King! Kesava is not to be obtained by those who have not conquered their senses". By these and other sayings, bad conduct is condemned as not being liked by the Lord: hence, it is adharma (sinful). (Even with reference to the passage quoted above from the Gita), this point is made clear by the words immedi ately following: "He at once becomes a man of virtuous conduct." (IX. 31) Again, bhakti is open to all, whether the person is in one or other asramas or is in no asrama at all (like a widower or snataka - a person who has completed his studies as a brahma charin and has not yet married and become a grithasha). So the Brahma sutras determine in the following and other aphorisms: "He (the householder) must have control of the senses and the mind' , (III. 4. 27); and ( "Knowledge of God can be attained) in the case of those outside (the asramas), as this is observed.'. (III.4.36). This is but proper. There is no prohibition of the recitation of the holy Names by any person whatever his position may be as in the case of a son with reference to his mother. For God is loving like a mother. He is the kinsman of all and a natural friend. See, for example, Gajendra, Jatayus, the crow (the son of Indra), Vibhishana (brother of Ravana), the people of Kosala, the gopikas and the garland maker. (maalaakaara).

Then the question arises: What about the Apasudra Adhikarana? What is stated there is something different. This is an adhikarana in the Brahma-Sutras, in which it is established that the Sudras are prohibited from studying the Vedas. What is prohibited to those other than the three higher castes is only the ceremonies connected with the sacrificial fire which the former have not learnt, and the supreme science (of God) to be known through the Vedanta, as they have not studied the Vedas under an instructor and obtained the necessary qualification by studying the Upanishads under a guru. There is no conflict as regards the right or eligibility for persons other than the three higher castes to seek refuge in Bhagavan if they are desirous of release because of an excess of sattva quality in them; but there is no recognised eligibility to adopt the great path of hearing, meditating etc; which has been set out in the Upanishads as Brahma Vidya. Even among the three castes, there are some who are deluded by the desires for fruits and whose sattvaguna is mixed up with rajas and tamas and has become impure here and there. They are eligibile for the Upasanas such as they can do. In the case of women of all castes, Sudras and animals, competency for upasanas based upon common virtues and duties not prohibited to the respective castes, can not be gainsaid. Such is the case with Vidura and Dharmavyadha. By reason of the force of the effects of experience gathered through a long series of lives knowledge has appeared again as in the case of a person awakening from sleep. They have merely permitted themselves to associate with inferior social classes to rid themselves of the traces of the evil effects of karma which had already started to function (and had given them the present birth). In respect of all these persons, knowledge is not generated in them afresh. "Vidura, Dharmavyadha and others in spite of their birth in lower castes, like Sramani, attained perfection (pure bhakti) on account of their knowledge, gained by them in their pre- vious births". ( Vishnu Dharma)

In the case of even those who have no knowledge of God, there is no prohibition about thinking of God, singing His praise and hearing of Him. These form the beginning of the bhakti proper, which they will develop in course of time. The great law-givers have laid down :- Dharmas which are open to all classes from the Chandala upwards are non-violence, truth, purity, service to others, love and gratitude towards parents and performance of acts pleasing to the Supreme Deity. Even when a person is forbidden to do sankirtana (praising God), he will get related to God indirectly by merely following, rejoicing with, tolerating or showing no enmity towards one doing sankirtana. In the Mahabharata, It is said: "A person gets purified, if he hears of dharma, sees it performed, speaks of it or approves of it". In fact, any dharma, relating to God, promoted, approved or practised is said particularlly to be sparsavedin (that is, something that transforms by mere touch). That is, a relation to God in any manner established purifies him. Again, it is said: "The Lord, cried to for help in a loud voice, worshipped, seen or bowed to (as in temple), destroys with force all sins. Who then will not worship Hari?"; ..Hari, whether worshipped remembered, meditated upon or adorned with flowers etc., grants all protection to a person in this world and the next" and .'Those who hear, read about Me or see or praise Me'. In the Itihasa and purana it is said that even a low born person like the dog-flesh eater is allowed to sing in praise of God (bhajana). Thus, in the Vishnu Dharma : "Narada ! That devotee of Mine who with faith says 'Salutation to Thee', even if he is a dog-flesh eater, attains the Eternal world." All these statements, which show that the persons above-mentioned should be highly esteemed and that they all attained moksha are all supported by authority. Since each mandate has a particular individual in view, the apparent contradictions in the sastras are reconciled and no sastra goes in vain. Thus far about Names.

Always (sada): This indicates that there is no dependenc on any particular time. It also indicates that there is no dependence on any place or condition of purity etc. Any time or place will do for worship, or any state, whether ceremoniously pure or not. Stotra (reciting praise) is thus superior to any other kind of worship which is connected with a particular half year, ritu (season of two months like Vasanta-ritu), month, fortnight or lunar asterism or auspicious hour. Thus, in the Vishnu Purana : "The Holy Names of the Discus-bearer can be sung at all times and places. There is no question of impurity for this kirtana of the Lord who is always holy". Again: "Where can there be any difficulty or unhappiness for a person to utter the names of Govinda. Krishna and Hari early morning at noon, or in the afternoon?". Such are the sayings of the rishis. There can be no question of the lord being sullied by contact with the pure or impure worshipper, nor is His power to grant favour affected by the absence of purity and other subsidiary qualifications on the part of the worshipper. On the other hand, the Lord purifies even one who is unfit to have contact with Him, and after making him fit for such contact with Him, He takes him unto Himself , because He is all-pure. Vishnu Dharma says: "No question of impurity for this kirtana of the Lord." The sastras, which speak of the comparative merits and demerits of worshippers, do so only with the view that there should be no scope for confusion in the performance of the functions of the various persons in high and low stations. As a matter of fact, sankirtana and such things so petty by themselves yield high gains. Thus. it is said: "Even a little of this dharma will rid a person of great fear (i. e. Samsara) (Gita 2.40). This dharma once commenced, is not lost though interrupted in the middle, like other dharmas (such as sacrifices etc.). "What is commenced is not lost" (Gita 2.40); 'My devotee never perishes" (IX. 33). Elsewhere also it is stated : He who Salutes Him, does not become unhappy"; "Saluting Vasudeva, one does not get into grief"; Saluting Janardana one sorrows not." There is no room for sin or loss of gain, if this dharma is done even irregularly or is obstructed by any powerful inimical agency. For it is said in the Gita: "No sin or loss of gain arises". (2.40). All these sayings are significant and meaningful and are not mere (empty) praise; they do not exaggerate.

Is it so? Is it not exaggeration to say that the praise of the Lord can lead one to salvation? No. Here what is spoken about is only the beginning of the preparation for attaining the Lord by destroying all the sins that stand in the way of the acquisition of true knowledge about Him and of bhakti by increasing one's sattva-guna. Hence it is said: "By uttering the two syllables, ha and ri, one gets ready for the journey to Heaven." (Vishnu Dharma). Again: 'A person who fixes his mind on Him does not go to Hell. After thinking of Him, even Svarga (the paradise of the gods) is regarded by him as an obstacle, and the world of the Creator Brahma as but a trifle. The Eternal Lord, presiding over the pure hearts of such persons, grants them the boon of immortality. If this is so, what surprise is there in saying that the praise of the Lord destroys sins?". (Note :- Nama sankirtana saves a person from hell and makes him feel that Svarga and Brahmaloka are trifles in comparison with salvation. This knowledge makes him purified of all imperfections and makes him fit for bhakti, and then it leads him on to final release, step by step).

(Here the commentator starts the question: Why not apply here the rule about purna-ahuti, the last or completing oblation, or the oblation made with a full ladle ? Though such ahuti is stated to secure all sorts of fruits, it has been ascertained by the Mimamsakas that such a statement is mere praise. The reasoning adopted there is that the purna ahuti is prescribed in the context of several other rites, some to be performed before and others to follow. If all the phalas mentioned are to be ascribed to this ahuti alone, the other rites will be fruitless and may be given up. But that is not the case here. For, in the context of speaking of sankirtana, no other rites are prescribed, nor is any rite combined with it; not even any prayers are mentioned. Mere sankirtana is enough certainly to destory sins. So the commentator sums up.) This is not subject to the purna ahuti maxim. For the subject there is exaggeration. Moreover, elements of arthavada like incomplete statement and prayers are not seen here. Besides even arthavada is not altogether to be neglected; if otherwise not opposed to any authority, we must not omit to give it its proper meaning and significance to the extent possible. To omit is improper.

(Then, the learned commentator starts the following question): It was said that the stava (recitation of praise) is capable of preparing a person for knowledge of the ultimate truth. Is not this also a bit of exaggeration ? For tattvajnana is not to be obtained easily, but only after very long and difficult austerity and concentrated meditation. But the stava involves just a slight exertion on the part of the tongue. Besides, if the same result is obtained in both cases, the performance of the more difficult sastraic acts will become unnecessary and the sastras relating to them will become of no use. And also this conclusion is opposed to all authority. (This objection is answered thus.) This is the gibberish of a scholar, of a person who has not realised fully the greatness of the Lord and has lost himself in chhandas (Karmakanda rituals). Reciting the praises of the Lord, however light or easy, does indeed carry a heavy burden. As for the prescription of difficult courses of discipline by the sastras becoming useless, it is not so. They are useful to those who are competent to perform the injunctions therein contained. This stava is open to those fortunate people, who have acquired a unique taste for enjoying the very many qualities of the Lord, though they may or may not possess the other capacity (to perform tapas, etc.). (After all, it is not the means, however great, that secures the result). The resulting gain in the case of the difficult discipline is due to the infinite grace of God. What is there to deter Him from granting His favours, even in the case of praise, slight though it be? It may also be justifiably said that, if in one He is pleased with the great trouble taken, in the other, He is delighted by the great sincerity of the mind (of the devotee). Hence, it is said in the Gita : "He (a person of wicked conduct, taking to bhakti) has rightly resolved" (IX. 30); and "A leaf, a flower or fruit or even a little water (I accept)" (IX. 26). In the Vishnu Dharma, it is said: "He is not pleased with offerings of wealth, or property, or clothes or ornaments, but only with the heart (pure and sincere). Who then will not worship Him?" In the Vyasa Smriti, it is stated: "He who offers flower or water (to God), at the same time reciting the Purusha sukta, has worshipped the whole world of moving and unmoving things". Again, the Vishnu Dharma says: '.Even if a person offers the whole world with all its gems to Krishna, he will not easily reach Janardana, if his mind is elsewhere,". The fundamental basis on which virtue and sin are decided is the difference of mental attitude and not particular acts. For it is said in the Vishnu Tattva : " It is the purity of the mind of the man that matters. When a man embraces his wife, his mind is in a different state from that when he embraces his daughter. It is also laid down in the Mahabharata: Tapas is good (lit. not sinful). recitation of the Veda is good, Vedic conduct is good, even taking another's wealth by force is good (for the worship of God); but if they are accompanied by a bad motive, they become sinful". Elsewhere it is stated : "Fish live in the holy Ganga, flocks of birds reside in temples: they are not benefitted by the holiness of the Ganga or of the temple, because they have not the necessary state of mind..."

It is but proper that, God who is omniscient, with no wish of His unfulfilled and not seeking anything from others, should be pleased with a pure heart and not by the offer of insignificant wealth. With even a little worship though marred by imperfection in regard to place, time or accessories, He is pleased as if it were perfect and complete. This is in accor- dance with the maxim that one who is wise, is pleased with truth. Hence it is said: "What benefit is gained by dhyana in the Kritayuga, by sacrifice in the Treta, and by worship in the Dvapara, the same benefit is obtained in the Kali by recitation (of names)" ( Vishnu Purana, VI. ii. 18). Also: "In the first quarter (of Kaliyuga), men will indulge in abuse of Hari's name. And at the end of the yuga, none will there be to take up Hari's name. If, even at that time, there may be some who disdain this ocean of sin and remember with some effort the name of Vishnu, indeed, they are the blessed, and their souls realise immortality." (Vishnu Dharma). This is but logical. A virtuous king regards with parental affection a person who, in spite of difficulties, conducts himself in a fair manner, if he (the subject) has rendered him great help. Hence, in the case of the worship of God or of ancestors, or expiatory ceremonies, though they are, according to time, place and circumstance, simple or elaborate in form, the result in any case is the same (i. e. the removal of sin.) Such is the practice of the eminent. Again, the remembrance of one's poverty or inability is regarded as equivalent to the performance, in emergencies, of the sraddha (the annual ceremony in honour of one's deceased parents) which has to be carried out elaborately, with the expenditure of all that one has. It has also been said: When it is impossible to perform the necessary rites, mere utterance of the appropriate mantras will do.

It is the conclusion arrived at by Bhishma that sankirtana and similar disciplines are the best form of worship of the Lord for the following and other reasons :- (1) The worship is of the dearest Person and hence performed with ease and no effort. (2) It can be done easily with littre or no expense or exertion. (3) It is attractive, because it is inspired by the consciousness that it is being offered to please one's own master, who is not very much out of sight. (4) Though the service is comparatively slight, it secures to the worshipper the great fruit of moksha which dispels the great and unbearable fear of the mortal world. (5) There is no sin incurred, even if the performance is not strictly regular or in the proper manner . (6) Those who are qualified to do this worship are innumerable, and hence it is suitable to all men, (7) There is nothing which can affect the worship on account of time, place, etc., and hence it is not dependent on any condition. (8) Owing to the glory of God, who is the object of worship, there can be no obstruction to the attainment of the goal. The above is the opinion of other rishis also, as stated in the following and similar passages: "Vishnu-worship is higher than any other form of worship. The Lord. Vishnu protects His devotees as His own body"; and "There is nothing higher than worshipful devotion to Govinda'.

Paramam Yo Mahat Tejah Paramam Yo Mahat Tapah I Paramam Yo Mahat Brahma Paramam Yah paraayanam II (9) Pavitraanaam pavitram Yo Mangalaanaam cha Mangalam II Then Bhishma proceeds to answer the question about the ultimate goal (parayanam) and directs Dharmaraja to listen to the Thousand Names in the following stanzas (9 to 12). There the first one and a half stanza deals with the second question (which relates to the ultimate goal). (9) (He) who is the supreme and great effulgence; who is the supreme and great director (tapas); who is the supreme and great Brahman; and who is the supreme and highest ultimate goal; (10) (a) He is the purest of the pure and who is the auspicious amongst the auspicious, The combination of the word yah (He who) in the masculine gender with tejas (radiance) and other wolds, which are in the neuter gender, should not make us think that there is confusion in genders. The attempt here is only to lelate a word (Pundarikaksha) with a number of new words different in gender. This is grammatically correct. For example, see "Vedah pramanam.' (' Vedas are the authority) (Vishnu Dharma) and "Tattvam Narayanah" (Narayana is the truth) (Narayana Sukta). In the former example, there is a difference in number and in the latter there is a difference in gender.) Vedah is plural and pramanam is singular; Tattvam is in neutel gender and Narayana in masculine. There are six attributes of the Lord mentioned to show that He is most attractive and that He is the Supreme purushartha (moksha) - (1) Effulgence (tejas), It is itself lustrous and It makes other things also lustrous., Thus it is said, "Having attained the Supreme Light'. (Chh. Up, VII.12.2) and "The sun shines with light borrowed from Him". (2) Great (mahat). This shows that there is no limit to His lustre. (3) Supreme (paramam). There is nothing equal or superior. This is the meaning to be adopted in later places also, (4) Director (tapas). He issues decrees and orders, He is the ruler, So it has been said: "He radiates His conquering powers for the sake of the gods" (Narayana Sukta); "Him who is the supreme ruler" (Svet. Up.VI.7); and He is the ruler of all" (Brih. Up. 4.422). (5) Brahman (the extremely great) - He is great because His nature and qualities are beneficent to an unlimited extent. He makes all others also great by His omnipotence.

(6) Purest of the pure (Pavitram) The words paramam (supreme) and mahat (great) should be understood here. The words mean that He is the agency for purifying in a particular way. Purification means the removal of impurity (doshas). Impurity arises in inanimate matter when it evolves under the influence of rajas and tamas. In the soul, It is caused by contact with such matter. And it consists of ignorance, offences against the Lord, attachment, hate, etc. The Lord alone is capable of destroying utterly the doshas root and branch, because He is always of a nature opposed to them. He is the purest of the pure. So proclaim the sastras: "He (the knower of Brahman) does not feel anxious (about his salvation) (Taitt. UP. 11. 9); 'just as water does not cling to the lotus leaf" (Chh. Up. IV. iv.3); "Just as a bit of cotton thrown into fire is burnt (Chh. Up. V. xxvi. 3); "He (the soul) shakes off his sins and merits (when attaining moksha),' (Kaush. Up. 1.4), "After getting rid of merits and sins the wise man..." (Mund. Up., III.1.3); "The highest purification for the soul is held to arise from knowledge of God,' (Yajnyavalkya Smriti'); and '.Remember Narayana while doing all acts in cluding bathing. This is the most efficacious expiation for all- sins". To the same effect the Gita says: .'He who knows Me or one without beginning and without birth" (X.3). In the Ramayana, it is said: "You are the purifier of all persons, O ! scion of the Raghu race. " The Vishnu Purana declares: "The continued remembrance of Krishna is the best of all expiatory ceremonies" (II. vi. 39), and also: "Vishnu, enshrined in the minds of the yogins, destroys all sins, as fire combined with wind flares up and burns dry grass" (VI. vii 74). The entire section on Prayaschitta (expiation) is full of such statements.

In other cases, like that of the sacred waters which are purifying agencies, they acquire that characteristic only by their contact with the Lord. This is shown by the adjectives, 'supreme' and 'great'. It is not reasonable to hold that either sentient beings who are themselves naturally impure or the gods whe are also affected by impurity can purify others who are similarly situated. Hence it is that Parasara, Saunaka and others in the context of subhasraya (God as the substratum of auspiciousness) prohibit contemplation and worship of other gods, Subhasraya means an object of worship or meditation which is at once auspicious (i.e., subha or sin-destroying) and easy asraya for contemplation. Thus: "All the gods are impure because they are born in karma and are subject to karma" (Vishnu Purana), VI. 7.77); "All beings in this world, from Brahma (the four- faced creator) down to a clump of grass, are all born in karma and are in the grip of samsara - Vishnu dharma). It is well stated (by authorities) that the gods acquire the capacity to purify only by contemplating on Him, worshipping Him, doing services to Him like sipping the water that has washed His feet, etc,. Similarly, the holy water and sacred temple acquire this capacity to purify only by their nearness to Him. Hence, says the Vishnu Purana (IV. 4.30) about the Ganga :"This is the greatness of the water that has flowed down from the toe of the left foot of Vishnu". And as for mere waters, it is said: "The waters are indeed the abode of Vishnu, and He is the Lord of the waters." In the same way, Time is (said to be auspicious and purificatory) because of its connection with Him, as being the hour of His Incarnation, or having Him as its deity, or as the hour of his going to sleep orwaking up, as for example dvadasi, (the welfth day of the lunar fortnight), jayanthi (birthday), sravanam, (a day when the moon is in conjunction with a lunar asterism in Capricorn sacred to Vishnu). Again atma-gunas (spiritual virtues such as self-contro1 , etc.) are said to be purificatory because they are helpful in knowing and realising Him. Sacrifices, charity, tapas and sraddha are purificatory because they acquire their purity because of their eligibility to study the Vedas which sing of Him. Hence it is said in the Mahabharata: "A Brahmin becomes a Brahmin and a seer of Truth only when he knows Vasudeva as the Pervader of the universe and as having traversed it by His feet. (Kranta)" The Vedas and the Smritis are also purifying as they are but His commands and recognise Him as supreme. Thus it is said: "The Vedas are about Narayana" (Bhagavata, 2, 5. 15.) and "The Srutis and Smritis are My commands". Temples are sacred and capable of cleansing a person because the Lord resides or presides there; this is so stated in the Mahabharata, Aranyaka, Tirthayatra chapter. Beginning with the statement, "Dvaraka is holy", it goes on to observe: There Hari, whose nature is beyond thought, and who has killed the demon, Madhu, dwells. It is holy, It is supremely great, it has holy waters, it is the penance-grove" (88. 24). Thus the purifying power of a place is said to be due to His connection with it. It is then concluded clearly: "Govinda indeed is the supremely pure among the pure. He is the holiest of the holy". (88. 26)

Auspicious of the Auspicious (Mangalanam cha mangalam) He is the most intensely desirable, being more desirable than fragrant garlands, sandal paste, heavenly damsels and even nectar, and also more desirable than the individual soul which has destroyed all the impurities of samsara and is full of bliss and knowledge in its essence, pure and unlimited. For these reasons, He is the Supreme Object to be attained. This will be elaborated later. (yah: He who): It would have been appropriate to conclude that such a Person is the supreme goal. Instead of this, there is the statement. "He who is the goal", as if this is established. The intention is to show that this indeed is well- known as well-established in the sastras.

What follows is the answer to the first question. The next stanza and a half are devoted to answering; "Who is the one Deity?" Daivatam devataanaam cha Bhootaanaam yo Avyayah Pitaa II (10) (b) Yatas-sarvani bhootaani Bhavanti Aadi-yugaagame I Yasmin cha pralayam yaanti Punar eva Yuga-kshaye II (11) (10) (b) The God of gods and the indestructible Father of beings. (11) From whom all beings originate in the beginning of the first yuga and in whom they merge again at the end of the yuga. He alone is the principal, who is the Great God of all the gods. i.e., of Siva, Brahma and others. Why? Because He is the Father of all the beings, that is those who are existent. The word 'Indestructible' is to show that He is not like ordinary fathers. When He is their ancient and imperishable Father they cannot be said to be without a protector at any time. How He is the father, is explained in the next stanza. From whom (yatah) denotes the nimitta karana, the instrumental cause, 'All' (sarvani) :- Beginning with Brahma (the four-faced) down to the stump of a tree. Beginning of the first yuga (Adiyugagame) is significant to show that in the beginning it was different from what prevailed after the creation of Brahma, when through him further creation proceeded. (That is, the Lord Himself directly was responsible for the primary creation at the beginning.)

Now about the Lord being the material cause: "Into whom alone all beings are dissolved" shows that the absorption is in the material cause of the effect. This is like the spider which absorbs its threads in its own saliva. The word cha (and) is used to denote (i) that He is also the auxiliary cause and (ii) that He is the cause for maintaining the universe, activating it, etc. The lord who is the Supreme Principle is defined as possessing this quality in the Vedas. For example: "From whom all these beings are born'. (Tatti. Up. III.) It is also stated in an aphorism in the Brahma Sastras:" From whom proceed the birth, etc" of this (universe)'. (I. i. 2.). That Brahman itself is all the three kinds of causes, viz, Nimitta, Upaadaana and Sahakaari, is illustrated from a Vedic text, "The Brahman is the forest. He is the tree" and established in the Brahma.Sustras (I. 4-23.): '.The Brahman is also the material cause because there is no contradiction of the proposition and there are illustrative examples." (To the question, '.Which is the tree from which the whole universe is shaped?", the answer given is: "The tree, the forest and the Director are the same Brahman." Some distribute the causes between two agencies, The lord is the material cause, and Mahesvara is the instrumental cause. Their stand is not based on Vedic texts. A question may be raised to the effect that if the Brahman is the material cause, that will be attributing to it imperfections like the quality of changing. There is no ground for such a question, for evolutionary and other changes are only in respect of prakriti (matter) and other things (souls) which constitute His own body. The example of the spider was cited by the respected Vedas only to meet this point.

Then, when the question by Yudhishthira was, "Who is the Supreme Deity7", the answer must naturally be "Vishnu". Instead of laying down a conclusion, Bhishma starts by saying yah (he who), (as if this is something already known to the questioner). This is to show that it is well-known from the sastras that Vishnu is the Supreme Deity of all deities. (When the Upanishads speak of the Lord. His characteristics, His reality, His worship with contemplation, attaining Him etc.) The words 'sat' 'Asat' 'Brahma" 'Akshara' etc. are used to describe the Supreme Being, sometimes without any attribute and sometimes with words like 'param' (Supreme) etc. Here doubts arise as to whether the reference is to Brahma (the four-faced) or to Hari or to Siva, etc. To set at rest these doubts, there occur passages like .'Narayana is the Supreme Brahman", "Narayana is the Supreme Reality." (Narayana Sukta); "That supreme abode of Vishnu" (Katha. Up., III. 9); "Nothing else is higher than Him (Vishnu)" (Svet, Up. III. 9); and "Nothing is higher than Purusha (the Supreme Person) ." (Kath. Up. 111, II). In the Gita also there are similar passages: "Nothing else is higher than I" (VII, 7) : and "The Highest Person is another" (XV, 17), All these proclaim this fact in clear words with no room for any other inference or doubt. Any intelligent person can easily come to the conclusion that Vishnu is the Highest Deity of unassailable rulership and that the others are not so high for the following reasons also : (1) the common trend of the scriptural statements about creation; (2) the purport or meaning of the Purusha Sukta, Uttara Narayana Sukta and other important passages; (3) the loud proclamations of many Upanishads like the Subala, Maitrayaniya, Mahopanishad, Chhandogya, Taittiriya, Katha and Aitareya; (4) the thoughts expressed by the sattvika puranas and itihasas; (5) the opinions of great sages like Parasara, Vyasa and Valmiki who know and have had direct perception of the Highest Deity; (6) the agamas which are in conformity with the Vedas and (7) the natural excellence of His form, weapons, vehicle and action, Again, our acharyas have come to the above conclusion; as stated by them in the 'Dahara' 'Vaisvanara' and other sections of the first chapter (Samanavya Adhyaya) of Brahms sutras. Hence there is no need to dilate further .

Yamunacharya also says the same thing in a brief way in the 15th stanza of the Stotra-ratna, which begins with "Thee by reason of Thy grace, beauty and deed." My (the commentator's) revered father also says, addressing Vishnu in the Vaikunta Stava (7) : "We feel convinced that thou art the Highest God from hundreds of passages in the Vedas which deal with the Highest Reality, from logicl inferences, from Smritis of like import, from sattvika puranas and from the opinions expressed by those who have attained the knowledge of God". Again: '.Learned men have also determined that Thou art the Supreme Lord from the beauty of Thy form. Thy superb radiance, some of Thy wonderful and appropriate exploits and some other clear and significant signs". (ibid 28).

(12) Tasya loka-pradhaanasya Jagannaathasya Bhoopate II Vishnor Naama-Sahasram me Srinu paapa-bhayaapaham II (12) Thus, the tattva (the Ultimate Reality) and the hita (the beneficial way of attainment) have been determined as superior to all else. Of these, a method common and beneficial to all is to be clearly set forth. So Bhishma invites Yudhishthira to listen : 12. O King! Hear from me the Thousand Names which remove sins and drive away fear, - of that Vishnu, Lord of the universe and Ruler of the world. Of that (Tasya) : Of Him whose supreme greatness has been set forth above. Lord of the universe (Lokapradhanasya) : The Lord on whom all without exception depend. Ruler of the world: He rules all. Thousand Names: Though there are so many other methods of pleasing Him, the Thousand Names are to be preferred which remove sins, etc. The Thousand Names: deserve the praise that they destroy sins and drive away all sorts of fears by the very roots. From me (Me), : From me or for my sake. (The Sanskrit word me is common to several cases, dative, ablative and genitive. Here it can be taken as either dative or ablative singular). O King! Hear Why this call to listen to one who is already listening of his own accord, and why the vocative 'O King"? These show that the speaker (Bhishma) felt that the gain of a listener for this matter was worthy of commendation.

Yaani Naamaani gaunaani Vikhyaataani Mahaatmanah I Rishibhih Parigeetaani Taani Vakshyaami bhootaye II (13) (Then he proceeds to set out what he will be speaking about.) (13) For the good (of the world), I shall tell you the (holy) Names of the Supreme Soul (Paramatman) which are indicative of His attributes and glory, well known and sung by the rishis, Indicative of attributes - (Gaunani): Generally, words are capable of four functions: to indicate (I) an individual, (2) a class, (3) a quality and (4) an action. (For example, Chaitra, a Brahmin, pure and doing charity.) The occasion for denoting an individual and a class arises respectively through the limitation of individuality and the presence of universality. And these are not relevant here. So, the word "Gaunani" is used here, to show that the names (of God) are derived from qualities and actions which have become the cause therefor. Their significance is derivative and etymological. Here the word "guna" must be taken to include activities also. In the Mahabharata, the Lord speaks of the etymological interpretations of His Names as referring to qualities and actions. He says. "Some of My Names are said to indicate qualities"; "He who knows the meaning of Names indicating action, O! son; and "Hear attentively from Me, O sinless one, the derivation of My Names which are applied to Me on account of My action", These Names are not without significance, because in each word each of its parts, .when analysed, bears a significant sense. The Names are not used, according to some capricious convention. Well known: These names are being used largely both in the Vedas and in ordinary literature. Hence, they are well known as exclusively applicable to Him, They are .~i. traditionally well known, Even though some of the times may apply to others in an etymological sense, yet they are peculiarly His own; For a name to be a name must apply only to one. By rishis : like Sanaka, Sanatkumara and Narada who have understood the essence of all the Vedas. Sung: sung on all sides (pari). These Names were applied as descriptive of Him, by them who explained the forms and reasons with an affection which is like that of a cow with a full udder towards its calf. They are culled from the sayings of various rishis, like honey gathered from various flowers by a bee, and strung together by Vyasa in the form of a stotra. They have come down up to us by tradition. For the good of All; Bhuti means existence, life. The meaning here is that this teaching is for the redemption of the soul which has been lost in beginningless samsara.

For, the Taittiriya Upanishad this describes the existence (sat) and non-existence (asat) of the individual soulI; "He who knows the Brahman as non-existent, himself becomes non- existent. Whoever knows the Brahman as existent is indeed truly existent. " (I,. vi. I) Of the great soul: Great is His glory and His knowledge deep and immeasurable. Hince it is impossible to give out all the Names of His. So it is said: "I have listened to the auspicious interpretation of the names of this God. From it I know only this, that Kesava indeed cannot be known fully." Those who wish to experience in this manner the Thousand Names of Vishnu, will be doing good to themselves. This is the meaning suggested by word Mahatmanah. The persons above-mentioned who are competent to utter these (Names of His) should not, as these Names are due to the gunas, mix with persons who are thieves of the gunas (i.e., those who deny these gunas to Vishnu or those who ascribe them to other deities).

Suppose you argue: "Let this teaching about the Brahman with attributes be for persons who are entitled to lesser objective (than final salvation); the teaching about the Brahman without attributes is indeed only for those who aspire for salvation."  
Fie unto you, your ears are indeed deaf! For you don't hear to what fruit these Names are the means - which is loudly proclaimed in this very stotra at the end (where the fruits of reciting it are mentioned) : "He is released from the bonds of samsara", and " He reaches the Eternal Brahman".  
If once you postulate two Brahmans, one with attributes and - one without attributes, the oneness of the Brahman (which you advocate) will be destroyed.  
With a view to know the best means of salvation according to the very essence of the sastras the question is put, "What is it you consider as the best dharma", and the answer is in the same words, "This is the best in my considered opinion"  
if you say that even then the lesser is mentioned, where else will there be an opportunity to reach the highest ? (That is to say, the question and answer denote that what is taught is the highest and nothing less than the highest truth).

Oh, Prattler! Do not argue that of the two, that is, of the worship of God with attributes and of God without attributes, the former is a step towards the latter.  
For, the two are contradictory to each other

Again what is the cause for one without attributes to appear as if it is with attributes ? If it is said to be due to avidya (nescience), then what a fascinating mystery about the Vedas (do we have) ! The Brahman, is said to be the best medicine to one who is about to die, having swooned from the poison of birth, death, delusion and other imperfections of life in samsara. How can that very Brahman be at the same time the abode of faults like nescience and delusion and be without even a trace of the smallest particle of (good) qualities?

If it is argued that the flaw in the Brahman is unreal,  
your argument about the attributelessness (of the Brahman also is) unreal.  

Is this quality real or unreal ?  
If the flaw is unreal ,  
then it means that the Brahman is (nairgunyam) without a fault.  
Similarly, if being devoid of attributes is unreal,  
then being endowed with attributes is real.  

So, even though you do not like it, it will become true -  
that the Brahman is without flaw and full of attributes.

There is another point to be answered. What is it that removes the nescience in the Brahman? If the answer is. "He who realises monism or oneness", then this is a more delight- ful statement. The Supreme Brahman is suffering from illusion and the bound individual soul in samsara redeems it. (This is stating the proposition upside down). Moreover, on what ground can the passages describing the Brahman as having qualities be said to be meaningless? If the answer is that these are contradicted by passages describing the Brahman as without qualities, why not the other way about? Both kinds of passages are equally authoritative and exercise equal force in contradicting (each other), Why reject the one and accept the other?

There is another point. If the qualities of the Brahman are to be negated, what is the purpose of these poor Vedic texts describing the Brahman as having qualities ? If the reply is that there is necessity to mention the existence of qualities for the purpose of negating them, why mention them at all and then negate them ? Is it written on its pate that the sastras should speak about an irrelevant thing and then say it is irrelevant? As the Mahabharata puts it: "Why touch the mud and clean it? Better keep away from it and do not touch it at all."

If it is argued that the rule in Mimamsa, (VI, 5. 19) that the later passages are more potent and negate the earlier ones like Prakriti, is to be applied here, no! The rule is not of uni- versal application. Besides, the earlier knowledge that a thing exists here cannot be stultified by the later statement that it is not. (Note).- The rule is exemplified in the following case : In the Pratassavana sacrifice, there are five priests who officiate, the "Adhvaryu". "Prastotri", "Pratihartri", "Udgatri" and 'Brahma'. When starting a prayer they move one behind another, round the sacrificial fire each taking hold of the girdle of the priest immediately before him. The sacrificer in turn has to take hold similarly of the 'Brahma' priest. It is laid down that if the 'Udgatri' accidentally lets go his hold, the sacrifice should be finished without distributing dakshina to the priests. It has to be started afresh and the dakshina prescribed in that case is that already prescribed. But if the 'Partihartri' lets go his hold, the dakshina prescribed is the whole wealth of the sacrificer. What is to happen, if both the 'Prastotri' and 'Udgatri' should lose hold, one soon after another? The rule is that the penalty prescribed in the later case is to prevail. Here, the penalties prescribed are opposed to each other and cannot be reconciled. Such is the rule.) When there is a breaking (of the chain of priests) round the sacrificial fire and this rule becomes relevant, the weakness of the earlier injunction is due to the fact that the later injunction cannot arise without wiping away the earlier one. Here (such a later statement) is said to arise. How to apply the rule here? The mention of the gunas and the denial of the gunas are not opposed to each other. Both may exist without contradicting each other. It may be argued that the passages negating qualities (to God) conceal (or obliterate) that part(of the scriptures) which affirms qualities, on account of the former passages being later. In that case, even the portion (of the Vedas) dealing with the nature of the Brahman may be stultified by the statement, "The (ultimate) Reality is non-existent": For this statement is later, If it is replied that this arises from the delusion of Buddhists and cannot affect anything established by the Vedas, the reply is not acceptable. For, according to you, the Veda itself arises from the delusion of the Brahman. And what distinction can be made between these two delusions? Moreover, if looked into carefully, the scriptural passages affirming qualities (in God) should be regarded as later, Passages like "He is sinless, free from old age (Chh. Up. VI,. 1.-1) prove that the mandatory declarations (of the Vedas) regarding the presence of auspicious qualities in (God) are later, being preceded by the negation of evil qualities in Him) by passages which deny attributes (to Him) and mean only that He is free from all impurities of the soul and the body.

It is also argued that the defence of the (co-existence) of passages affirming and denying qualities (to God) lies in their being distinguished as false and true (respectively). Even this is misleading talk. For there is stultification of the authority (of the Vedas as a source of knowledge), when it deals with false matters, as when there is false perception of silver (in lead or mother-of the pearl) perception loses its validity (as a source of knowledge). If it is your opinion that passages in the Vedas affirming qualities to God are to be ignored as false, why not ignore as false the passages denying qualities? Enough of this idle talk.

What then is the true position? The Vedic texts ascribing knowledge, power, etc., to the Brahman are with reference to the existence of beneficent and good Qualities a and the texts that deny qualities mean only that it is devoid of bad qualities such as attachment, hatred etc. Passages like "His wishes are true, His resolves are fulfilled" (Chh. Up. VIII. i, 5) illustrate auspicious qualities. While the denial in general terms of attributes can get its full meaning by restricting it to another aspect (namely, evil qualities), there is no necessity to say that the Brahman is not possessed of good qualities. This rule (that the general yields to the special) is to be found fully authoritative in 'Pad-ahavaniya', 'Brahmana Parivrajaka', 'Brahmana Koundinya', 'Gobalivarda' and similar maxims. [Note: Padahavaniya :- In the horse-sacrifice, some homas are prescribed to be performed on the hoof-marks of the horse, (Generally the homa is to be made only in a fire. The special mention of hoof- marks overrides the general rule about making oblations only in fire. Brahmana Parivrajaka : The term 'Brahmana' is general, while Parivrajaka (an ascetic) is special, Brahmana Koundinya : Again, 'Brahmana is general, while 'Koundinya' is special as referring to one belonging to the Koundinya gotra. Go-balivarda : 'Go (cattle) is general, balivarda (bull) is special] to bad qualities not found in the. Brahman; these words, go hand in hand with word, that lay down positive attributes. The latter speak equally explicitly of the existence of good qualities in the Brahman. In the same sentence, we find used with respect to the Brahman words like "He is sinless" at the beginning, and "His wishes are true, His resolves are fulfilled" (Chh. Up. VIII. ,. 5) at the end. Again, another text begins with the statement. "That which is invisible," and ends: "That which the wise see as the source of all beings, is eternal, all-pervading, existing everywhere, very subtle and imperishable" (Mund. Up. ,. 1.6.). Why then trouble about nyayas (analogies, maxims or arguments)? It is as plain as pikestaff, as when one man says "There is a pillar" and another says "There is no pot". (The one does not contradict the other). The author of the Vedanta Sutras explains in detail (in regard to God) the denial of visibility and such other qualities and the existence of auspicious qualities opposite there to in the aphorism. "That which is des- cribed as unseeable etc. (is the Paramatman), as qualities (peculiar to Him) are mentioned". (I. 2. 22.)

So he says: "The noble qualities of Brahman should not be ignored, because the Sruties show a great ardour in associating them with Brahman". (III. iii. 39) The venerable Parasara says clearly: "Sattva and other qualities of matter do not exist in the Lord" (Vishnu Purana, 1.9.44). and also "He is possessed of all auspicious qualities" (I bid, VI. 5, 54)

(The following passages bear this out) - "All good qualities inhere in Him". (Chh. Up. IV. xv. 2); "He is the controller of all, the ruler of all". (Brih. Up. VI. iv. 2); "He who understands all and knows all" (Mund. Up. I. i 10), "The Vedas say His mighty power is natural to Him, is of various kinds, and consists of knowledge, strength and activities" (Svet. Up. VI. 2); "Narayana is the father, mother, brother, the home, the refuge, the good-hearted friend and the ultimate goal'. (Subala Up VI ), "Creator of all actions, He is all sweet perfumes, He is all sweet tastes'. (Chh. Up. III. xiv. 2). In the 'Anandavalli' (of the Taittiriya Upanishad), it is demonstrated that mind and speech return (without comprehending the extent) from His bliss, because of the unlimited extent of His knowledge, might, and youth. The Vishnu Purana, in the context of explaining the connotation of the word "Bhagavan" mentions all His qualities in the passage beginning with "Pure and possessed of great glory" (VI. 5. 72.) Bhishma says in the Sabha Parvan (of the Mahabharata) : "I have served many virtuous men, ripe in wisdom and have heard from them the much- prized qualities of Sauri (Lord Krishna). I consider that Hari is the best person to be worshipped because of these qualities". Again, in Karna Parvan, he says: "The attributes and gunas of that great Victorious Person, the son of Vasudeva, adorned by the discus and conch and mace in His hands, cannot be sufficiently extolled by all the worlds gathering together and for tens of thousands of years' '. Also in the Varaha Purana: "If there is a person blessed with a life as long as that of Brahma (the four-faced Creator) and endowed with a crore of tongues and a mind pure and clean, such a person may perhaps be able to enumerate a ten thousandth part of Your qualities, or may not. Best of the gods! Be pleased with me". In the Matsya Purana : "lnnumerable are the qualities of the Supreme Soul as are the gems hidden In the ocean". The Vishnu Dharma also says : "The qualities of the Supreme Soul who is devoid of qualities like sattva or rajas of Prakriti, cannot be told by all the groups of rishis". The Mahabharata and the Ramayana also contain many passages of a similar nature.

Those who (like Bhaskara) say that the Brahman Itself becomes involved in samsara, conditioned by some limitation, as well as those who (like Yadavaprakasa) say that the Brahman itself become involved in samsara by mutation of its essential nature, will have to admit that Brahman is liable to all kinds of imperfections like being conditioned and being subject to changes. Hence the names of the Lord like 'pure', 'auspicious'. 'the highest' will get angry. i. e., will be inappropriate. Besides. others like Sri Sankara say from passages like "From Him speech and mind turn away unable to reach Him." (Taitt. Up. 11.9), that the Vedas and other authorities cannot adequately speak of the Brahman. This is not correct either. For, in that case the Brahman will become tuchcha, an imaginary and non-existent thing, (like a mare's nest.) Moreover, in the very passage quoted, it is said, "The bliss of the Brahman " and "From whom words" return. There will be contradiction of the quality (of bliss) attributed (to the Brahman here). Again, if bliss is not a quality of the Brahman, one will naturally expect the Upanishad to say that the Brahman has no ananda (bliss); but it says that mind and speech turn away from His bliss. If the Brahman cannot be established by the sastras, all the sastras will be of no use. Even the study of the knowledge of the Brahman (Brahma-mimamsa) which is begun with the Sutra "Then therefore the desire to know the Brahman" (Vedanta Sutras, I. I) need not have been started at all. Such a theory will conflict with a number of other passages like "By all words, He is the person ultimately indicated'; and "A person not versed in the Vedas cannot think of Him, the Great". Again the Vedanta Sutra (1.1. 3) says: "Because the sastras alone are the source of knowledge (about God)' '. The Anandavalli section of the Tattiriya Upanishad starts with the words, .'We will investigate into the measurement of bliss," and goes on multiplying the bliss a hundred fold at each stage and arrives towards the end at the bliss of Brahma (the four-faced creator). From the very order in which the manifold nature of the bliss is mentioned, it is clear that what is aimed at is to describe a bliss, vast and immeasurable, and not to postulate that there is no quality like bliss at all. Hence, the author of the Vedanta Sutras says: "(The relevant passage) negates the 'this-muchness' of the description of the Quality mentioned. '. (III. ii. 21). The principle enunciated there has to be applied here.

Moreover, when there is a prohibition of the imaginary attribution of name, class to the Lord, it is thereby established that He has qualities which are not imaginary, but fundamentally real. Thus, you (the opponent) yourself supply the fetters to bind your feet. Even the - invocation "Oh Lord", shows that He has a name. Not only this, it shows that He can be within the reach of speech, even though He is beyond it (in another sense). The passage only means that, He cannot be denoted by words expressive of limited things. But He is possessed of names and forms suitable to Him and different from those found in the universe. This is made clear elsewhere: "His names, forms and activities which constitute all the source of knowledge concerning Him, are not within the range of measurement. Such a Person, i.e., Vishnu is now in your womb." (Vishnu Purana, V.2.19).

आह - नामसु अवयवार्थानां न प्रवृत्तिनिमित्तत्वम् । निमित्तत्वेऽपि न तत्र प्रामाण्यं, तात्पर्याभावात् इति ॥ तत् अतिस्थवीयः तदर्थप्रतीतेः स्वतः प्रामाण्यात्, अनपवादत्वात् "यानि नामानि गौणानि" (सहस्रनाम) "आस्य जानन्तो नाम चिद्विवक्तन" इत्यादिना भगवद्गुण-तात्पर्यावगमाच्च ॥ मन्त्रवत् शास्त्रान्तरप्रमित-भगवद्गुण-स्मारकत्वेऽपि न गुणापहारः, सुदृढ प्रमाण-सिद्धत्वात् । अत एव हि अत्र उपोद्धात-निगमनयोः गुणादि-प्रकर्षं प्रतिपा-द्य सुद्रढय्य च, मध्ये तत्स्मरणाय नामानि विधीयन्ते । अमीषु नामसु अन्यतममपि सर्वस्मै फलाय कल्पते । एकतरस्य भगवच्छास्त्रादिषु द्वादश-अष्ट-षडक्षरादिषु मूल-मूलि-मन्त्ररूपेण परिणमय्य स्वातन्त्र्येण सर्वार्थेषु विनियोगात्, "नाम चिद्विवक्तन" इति एकवचन-सामञ्जस्याच्च ।

Some say: In the use of these Names, there is no scope for analysing each word into its parts and finding the actual meaning as derived from the meanings of each part. The real object is not to teach us the qualities. (That is to say, these names are used only as a help for the devotee to realise the Nirguna Brahman through the recitation of the qualities of the Saguna Brahman, a step towards such realisation.) This is an uncritical and highly exaggerated statement even on the surface. Because, these are words, significant conveying definite ideas, which cannot be ignored, and there is no authority to ignore, them. Besides, Bhishma himself describes these (holy) Names as gaunani (descriptive of His qualities.) The Vishnu Sukta speaks of "Those who have understood the meaning of the Names after analysing them into their components". Thus, the object of using the Names is only to remind us of the very many qualities of the Lord. It may well be that these Names remind us only of qualities known to us from other sastras as in the case of mantras. But that does not mean that the qualities denoted by the words ara altogethar non-existent. (For example, mantras are uttered in praise of certain deities before under- taking any ritual, like a sacrifice. The deity concerned is already known by the mandatory injunctions in the Vedas, and the mantras help only to remind the devotee of the detiy. On that reason, it cannot be argued that the mantra is not an authoritative source of knowledge.) Therefore, it is that in the introductory portion of this stotra as well as in its conclusion, Bhishma extols the gunas (including the actions) of the Lord: and the enumeration of the Names in the body of the stotra is for making us remember those qualities. The reason is that the uttering of even one of the holy Names is potent to grant us all benefits. Such a name becomes equivalent to mantras like the twelve-syllabled (Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya) , or eight-syllabled (Om Namo Narayanaya) or the six-syllabled (Om Namo Vishnave). A mantra may be made the principal and all the others subsidiary: It is so stated in the Bhagavata scriptures. (And single Names by such. relationship with potent mantras give us all benefits.) As quoted from the Vishnu Sukta, "Namachit Vivaktana'. the word used, is in singular; it bears out the above statement about the potency of a single Name fully.

In the chapters in the Mahabharata relating to the explanations of the meanings of the Names, it may be seen that, though it is true that Names pronounced merely and without knowledge of their meaning help, still revelation of the qualities through etymological interpretation quickly affords delight to mind and purity to heart. Thus: "Vyasa sitting with his disciples has praised Madhusudana by singing His holy Names. Please be good enough, venerable Sir, to teach me the full significance of these names. I am sincerely eager to hear. Hearing (the meaning of the Names) of Hari, the Lord even of the Creator , I shall become pure without any blemish like the autumnal moon' , (Santi-parvan, 342); and Dhritarashtra says: "O Sanjaya ! I ask of you tell me about the Lotus-eyed. I shall attain Him, dear sir by knowing the meaning of His holy Names and His activities:' (Udyoga- parvan, 59.)

The way to make Use of the Names along with their signs and symbols can be learnt from the words and the passages contained in the explanatory chapters of the 'Udyoga', 'Moksha- dharma" and "Vaishnava dharma" and also from the books that lay down the rules for performing japa in respect of each mantra. THUS ENDS The Introduction to be commentary called Sri Bhagavad- Guna-Darpana explaining the Thousand Names of Vishnu, written by Sri Ranganatha who is the shining star of Harita race, who is the son of Sri Vatsanka Misra and on whom was conferred the name of Parasara Bhatta by the divine command of Sri Rangaraja.
