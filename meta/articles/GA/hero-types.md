Many ways to be a hero--One of my favorite passages from the Mahābhārata

When Yudhiṣṭhira asks Bhīṣma (who is on his death-bed made of arrows) about, among several other things, the puṇya gained by a śūra (hero) who does not flee from battle, Bhīṣma proceeds to answer this volley of queries; and when he comes to the subject of heroes, he expands Yudhiṣṭhira’s narrowly phrased question (which restricts the ambit of “śūra” to the warrior on the battlefield) and utters these beautiful ślokas:

> śūrā bahuvidhāḥ proktās teṣām arthāṃś ca me śṛṇu |  
śūra-anvayānāṃ nirdiṣṭaṃ phalaṃ śūrasya caiva ha || 22 ||  
yajñaśūrā dame śūrāḥ satyaśūrās tathāpare |  
yuddhaśūrās tathaivoktā dānaśūrāś ca mānavāḥ || 23 ||  
buddhiśūrās tathaivānye kṣamāśūrās tathāpare |  
ārjave ca tathā śūrāḥ śame vartanti mānavāḥ || 24 ||  
tais tais tu niyamaiḥ śūrā bahavaḥ santi cāpare |  
vedādhyayanaśūrāś ca śūrāś cādhyāpane ratāḥ || 25 ||  
guruśuśrūṣayā śūrāḥ pitṛśuśrūṣayāpare |  
mātṛśuśrūṣayā śūrā bhaiḳṣyaśūrās tathāpare || 26 ||  
sāṃkhyaśūrāś ca bahavo yogaśūrās tathāpare |  
araṇye gṛhavāse ca śūrāś cātithipūjane || 27 ||  
sarve yānti parāṃl lokān svakarmaphalanirjitān || 27   

Heroes are spoken of as being of many kinds (śūrā bahuvidhāḥ proktāḥ). Hear from me their meanings (teṣām arthāṃś ca me śṛṇu), and to the result prescribed for the lineages of heroes (śūra-anvayānāṃ nirdiṣṭaṃ phalaṃ) and for the hero himself (śūrasya caiva ha).

There are heroes of sacrifice (yajñaśūrāḥ), heroes inself-restraint (dame śūrāḥ) and heroes of truth (satyaśūrāḥ). Heroes of battle (yuddhaśūrāḥ) have also been spoken of, and likewise men who are heroes in giving (dānaśūrāḥ).

There are others who are heroes in intellect (buddhiśūrāḥ) and others who are heroes in forgiveness (kṣamāśūrāḥ). There are heroes in the matter of honesty (ārjave śūrāḥ)--men who live in peace (śame vartanti mānavāḥ).

Through various observances, many other kinds of heroes exist (tais tais tu niyamaiḥ śūrā bahavaḥ). There are heroes devoted to Vedic study (vedādhyayanaśūrāḥ) and heroes devoted to teaching the Veda (śūrāḥ cādhyāpane ratāḥ).

There are heroes by reason of service to their preceptors (guruśuśrūṣayā śūrāḥ), and others by their service to their fathers (pitṛśuśrūṣayā). There are heroes in their service to their mothers (mātṛśuśrūṣayā śūrāḥ) and others who are heroes of the mendicant life (bhaiḳṣyaśūrāḥ).

Many are heroes of Sāṃkhya (sāṃkhyaśūrāḥ) and others are heroes of Yoga (yogaśūrāḥ). In the forest (araṇye śūrāḥ) and in the householder’s dwelling (gṛhavāse śūrāḥ), men are also heroes in the honouring of guests (śūrāś cātithipūjane).

All of these heroes go to the highest worlds (sarve yānti parāṃl lokān), won by the fruits of their own actions (svakarmaphalanirjitān).

The Mahābhārata is a treasure beyond compare.
