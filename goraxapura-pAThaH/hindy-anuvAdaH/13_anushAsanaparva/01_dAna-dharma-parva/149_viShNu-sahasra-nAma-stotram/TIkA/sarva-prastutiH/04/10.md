<details open><summary>पराशरभट्टः</summary>

सर्वैश्वर्यादपि पराऽस्य कल्याण-गुण-समृद्धिः इति परर्द्धिः । परावस्थस्यापि हि रामस्य अवर-सोमादिदेव-गुणैकदैश-निदर्शनं क्रियते । यथा-- "विष्णुना सदृशो वीर्ये शोमवत् प्रियदर्सनः" (राम.बाल.1.18) इत्यादौ । परत्वं च अत्रैव-- "एतत् तदुक्तम् अव्यक्तम् अक्षरं ब्रह्मसंमितम् । देवानां हृदयं सौम्य ! गुह्यं रामः परन्तपः ।।" (राम.यु.122.31) "बहवो नृप! कल्याणगुणाः पुत्रस्य सन्ति ते" इत्यादि । (राम.अ.2.26) "भगवते" इति स्वमन्त्र-वर्णाच्च ।। [नि-391. कल्याणां पराणां च गुणानाम् ॠद्धिदः सदा । परावस्थतया चैव परर्द्धिः इति कथ्यते ।।]

He of noble and auspicious qualities. The abundance of the auspicious qualities in भगवान् in His Incarnation as राम is superior even to the Supreme Overlordship of सर्वेश्वर . Hence He is Parardhih. It is because of this that, even though रामा-'s status is very high, He is often compared with सोम and other gods who are of a lower rank. Vide : "In valour रामा is similar to विष्णु ; He has a delightful appearance like the Moon." राम is endowed with transcendent nature. (This is revealed by the words of Dasarattha addressed to लक्षमण ) : "Dear son (लक्षमण) : It has been declared (by Brahma and other gods) that this राम is really the Supreme Brahmam incarnate. He cannot be realised by those who are bereft of devotion. He is immutable by nature. He is the inner Soul of all gods and a Mystery that can be known only by means of the उपनिषद्s. He is the conqueror of His enemies." "O King (Dasarattha) Many are the auspicious qualities, that are in your son, श्री राम." These are the words of the members of the Assembly summoned by Dasarattha for consulting them about Rama's coronation. "Unto भगवान् " is the phrase in the Manthra that pertains to Him, (i.e. श्री राम )

स्पष्टः He whose greatness is explicit. He is Param-spashtha. His greatness can be clearly cognised by means of direct perception. He is Parama-स्पष्ट. His greatness can be clearly cognised by means of direct perception. Vide : "It is evident that Sri Rँma is 'महा-योग'He is ever immersed in the one great thought of the protection of the world. He is the Supreme Soul and eternally existent (without any mutations.)" "श्री राम is the Sun even of the Sun."

अधिकृत-अधिकारात् परत्वादपि अतिशयेन समस्त-मनुष्या-द्यधिकारयोः दाशरथित्व- जगत्पालनयोः लाभात् प्रीतः तुष्टः । यथा-- "पितरं रोचयामास तदा दशरथं नृपम्" (राम.बा.15.31) "कुलोचित-मतिः क्षात्रं धर्मं स्वं बहु मन्यते" (राम.अ.1.16) "आत्मानं मानुषं मन्ये क्षात्रं धर्मं स्वं बहु मन्यते" (राम.यु.120.11) [नि-393. लाभात् दाशरथित्वस्य जगतः पालनस्य च । मनुष्यत्वेऽपि यः प्रीतः स तुष्ट इति कथ्यते । ]

He who was pleased. He was much more pleased with the attainment of the state of being the son of Dasarattha and being the protector of the world when the entire humanity would have the right to approach Him for help than with the state of Supreme Lordship which can be resorted to only by those who have the necessary qualifications. Vide : "Then Bhagavँn chose Dasarattha as His father.". "राम highly valued the Dharma (duty) of a क्षत्रिय quite in consonance with the fact that He had taken birth in the race of क्षत्रिय. " "I consider myself a human being राम the son of Dasarattha"(these are the words of राम to the gods who appeared before Him).

The Auspicious eyed. He has charming lotus-like eyes which are cool, large, magnanimous and long which reveal His lordship and also His amiable nature. "He has beautiful eyebrows and long red eyes. He is indeed Bhagavँn विष्णु Himself." Or the word 'शुभेक्षण ' can be taken to signify : to be the object that is seen or to be the agent who sees; both were to His liking. Vide : "Whoever has not seen राम or whomsoever राम has not seen, that person stands condemned by all the people in the world, and even his own self condemns him."

He who delights. He is राम, "because all are always delighted by Him being charmed by His form and qualities". Vide : "राम is the foremost among those who delight (the minds of all people)." "राम , Who is fascinating by virtue of His qualities." "राम , the dark-hued and red-eyed youth, Who is majestic like the best of elephants." "Like the Sun that shines with its rays, राम shone brightly with His qualities which charmed the subjects of His kingdom and which were a source of joy to His father." This is revealed, also by the Manthra about Him. "Unto Him Who has the splendour of the autumnal blue lily and a lovely body."

He before Whom all become powerless. He is विरामः, because before Him all become powerless-all, gods like Brahma who grant the boons, रावण and others who have acquired the boons (by their austerities) and the boons themselves of being indestructible even by death. Vide : "The four-faced and self-born Brahma (rudra, the three-eyed destroyer of the three cities of gold, iron and silver, and Indra the great chief of gods-no one can save that person whom राम has willed to slay)."

विसर्ग-नैरपेक्ष्येण कृपणात् राज्यादेः विरतः । यथा-- "न चास्य महतीं लक्ष्मीं राज्यनाशोऽपकर्षति । लोककान्कस्य कान्तत्वं शीतरसमेरुव क्षपा ।।" (राम.अ.19.32) "स पितुर्वचनं श्रीमान् अभिषेकात् परं प्रियम् ।" (राम.सु.33.25) "धर्मोपदेशात् त्यजतश्च राज्यं मां टाप्यरण्यं मयतः पदातिम्" इत्यादि ।। (राम.सु.36.29) भरद्वाजादि-मुनिभिः मार्ग्यते इति मार्गः ।। विरजो मार्गः इति पाठे विरजाः-अपांसुलो निर्दोषः तद्दर्शितो मार्गः इति । यथा -- "या गतिर्यज्ञशीलानाम् आहिताग्नेश्च या गतिः ।" (राम.आ.68.29) "आवहत् परमां गतिम्" (राम.कि.17.8) [नि-398. निसर्गनैरपेक्ष्येण राज्यादेः कृपणाद्धिः यः । विरागी विरतः स स्यात् सप्तार्णवः परमाद्भूतः ।।]

The Unattached. भगवान् is विरतः, because of the spirit of detachment which is natural to Him. He has no love for kingship and other trifles. Vide "Even the loss of the kingdom did not deprive Him (राम) of His splendour just as the night cannot take away the loveliness of the cool-rayed moon." "The carrying out of the order of exile given by His father was much more to His liking than even the coronation. Then He really shone with splendour." "Even when श्री राम abandoned the kingdom under the plea of Dharma (viz. Obeying father's words), and when He led me to the forest where I had to move on foot, (there was neither disappointment nor grief, nor fear in राम "सीता says.) मार्गः He Who is sought after. He is sought after even by sages like भरद्वाज. विराजो मार्गः is another reading. 'विराजः' means dustless (i.e. faultless); 'मार्गः ' signifies 'path'. The meaning is : 'The path shown by श्री राम is faultless.' Vide : "The goal of those who are in the habit of conducting sacrifices as well as the goal of those who tend and worship the (five) fires, (you will attain that goal by my command)." (These are the words of श्री राम to जटायु .) "(The arrow discharged from the bow of श्री राम ) secured for वालि the Supreme Goal."

He Who is governed by his devotees. He willingly heeds the commands of His friends; hence He is Neya. Vide :-- "I am agreeable to be commanded by those who practise austerities." "I wish to have an abode in this forest here in a place allotted by you". "Though wise and capable by himself, a person desirous of permanent good should, in times of difficulties, consult his good-hearted friends and agree to be guided by them." In the सभा पर्व (महाभारत), श्री कृष्ण Himself says : "O युधिष्ठिर ! When I am here for doing what is good to you, conduct the sacrifice (राज सूय यज्ञ) that you desire to do. You may ask me to do whatever you want. I shall certainly carry out your behests." Again in the उद्योग पर्व (महाभारत ) : "O long-armed scion of the royal dynasty of Bharatha! I am here ready to do whatever you want. I shall carry out your commands." (लक्षमण was struck by the weapon, Sakthi by name, and had fallen down unconscious.) All the inimical राक्षसा-s joined together and tried to lift and carry him away. They could not even move him. But he was light to Hanuman (the son of वायु) who lifted him single-handed because of the latters's love and devotion for him."

He who draws towards Himself all. He is Naya, because all the beings are drawn towards him by His benevolent nature.The sages themselves said to राम "We are to be protected by Thee always like children, even though we are sages with penance as our treasure." "(O कृष्ण !) Thou art the protector of the पाण्डवा-s; so we also resort to Thee for protection."
